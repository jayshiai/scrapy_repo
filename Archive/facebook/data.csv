7,2213636405702104,"I have planned strike questions. I hope someone who lives in Italy or has lived through strikes in Italy will have the answers!

I don't understand quite how they work. There are two planned strikes for when we will be in Italy. One is a rail strike that affects Italo, nation-wide. Naturally, we are scheduled to travel that day. The other is air traffic controllers, nation-wide.

The rail strike is scheduled for September 17-18, beginning at 3:00 AM on the 17th until 2:00 AM on the 18th, so 23 hours. We will be traveling at 8:30 AM on the 18th. Does this mean the trains will be backed up? How do we find out if our train will go that day at all if they are backed up?

The second strike is for what I think is air traffic controllers on September 16 from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, although I don't think this one will affect us (but not positive) as we land at 11:30 AM on September 17. In this case, do planes just not take off from or for Italy that would be landing during the time period of the strike since there is no traffic control? I'll assume it will back up traffic for a day or two?

We don't typically experience this level of strikes in the US with such regularity, so I'm not sure of how stikes like these work or affect travel, locally and nationally. BTW, there are a LOT of planned strikes for local transportation all over Italy for September. You may want to check the strike calendar, just be sure you have Google translate on so you can read it properly--put in dates that would affect you.

I can imagine how disappointed you are.\n\nBut as someone who was involved in a life threatening accident in Rome that required hospitalization\nand surgery I have to say I‚Äôm glad his problem\nhappened here instead of in Italy. To be honest, I received excellent medical care there and they saved my life. But it‚Äôs very frightening and psychologically\ndifficult to deal with a medical system you‚Äôre unfamiliar with. And where you maybe aren‚Äôt fluent with the language. (I can say some common phrases in Italian but medical terms were beyond me.). Then there‚Äôs the financial aspect. Before leaving the first hospital I had to pay 24 thousand Euros for my stay of three days plus surgery. The second hospitalization\nwhich lasted two full weeks was additional. I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you how stressful it would have been to face those worries in a foreign country on top of concerns for your sons health.\n\nOn the bright side, as I said before, I was treated very well by the doctors and hospital staff. All of my hotels were extremely cooperative and refunded my non refundable payments in full. I hadn‚Äôt expected that but was certainly happy they did it. I had purchased flight insurance which covered my missed flight back home. I was also lucky in that my home medical insurance reimbursed me in full for the amount I had to pay the Italian hospitals. And my insurance also paid for a first class flight ticket to get me home as well as paid for a nurse to accompany me.\n\nSo although you were unlucky with what happened, in another way you were lucky it happened before your trip not while you were on it.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I learned from my own experience.\n1. Buy medical insurance for each trip. Most US policies do not provide for the reimbursement mine did. But you do need to have coverage while abroad.\n2. Buy flight insurance. It‚Äôs cheap\nbut so important if something happens.\n3. Be sure any insurance you have provides for evacuation home.\n4. Always book directly with the provider (the airline or the hotel itself, for example) because the third party is just another layer of bureaucracy you have to deal with if something goes wrong.\n5. Stay in a fully staffed hotel not a vacation rental. The help provided by the hotel staff was invaluable to me. From going with me in an ambulance, to making arrangements to extend my husband‚Äôs longer than intended stay at reduced rates, to making phone calls for us I honestly can‚Äôt imagine how we‚Äôd have navigated the situation without their kindness and help. They did so many things, both little and big, to help\nus out during our nightmare. I‚Äôll be forever grateful to all of them.\n6. Take along an extra high limit credit card to be used only in case of an emergency.\n\nNone of this will help you right now. But I wanted you to know you‚Äôre not alone in having had a trip ruined by medical issues. I‚Äôm proof that anything can happen so I hope passing on what I learned might somehow help to prevent struggles in the future.\n\nAnd of course, I hope your son is fine and healthy now.

The fountain is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rome, and it is always crowded, even in the off-season. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel with access to public transportation,\nI would recommend staying in a hotel in a less crowded area, such as Trastevere or the Monti neighborhood.\n\nAnd also yes, queen and king size beds are not as common in Europe as they are in the United States. The standard bed size in Europe is a double bed, which is about the size of a twin bed in the United States. However, there are some hotels that do offer queen and king size beds, but they may be more expensive.\n\nHere are some reasonably priced hotels in Rome with access to public transportation:\n\nHotel Forum: This hotel is located in the historic center of Rome, near the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. It has a metro station right outside the door, making it easy to get around the city. The hotel has a variety of room sizes, including double, twin, and family rooms.\n\nHotel Raphael: This hotel is located in the Monti neighborhood, a short walk from the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. It has a bus stop right in front of the hotel, making it easy to get around the city. The hotel has a variety of room sizes, including double, twin, and family rooms.\n\nHotel Santa Maria: This hotel is located in the Trastevere neighborhood, a lively and charming neighborhood with a lot of restaurants and bars. It has a metro station within walking distance, making it easy to get around the city. The hotel has a variety of room sizes, including double, twin, and family rooms.\n\nI hope this helps!'}]"

I lived in California for many years and helped lots of people planning their dream tour of Tuscany. Now I moved back to Italy. How many days? My main recommendation is not trying to visit as many places as possible... you can only see/enjoy a handful of places in one or two weeks.. then of course each person has is own interests and travel style so, depending on your budget and number of travelers, I would suggest to contact someone that does custom tours for small groups.'}]"

Florence is also a great city for wandering around and exploring the narrow streets and alleyways.\n[Image of Florence, Italy]\n[Image of Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy]\n* **Siena:** This beautiful medieval city is known for its Piazza del Campo, a large square with a shell-shaped fountain. Siena is also home to the Leaning Tower of San Gimignano, a 14th-century tower that is one of the most iconic landmarks in Italy.\n* **Pisa:** This city is home to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. Pisa is also a great place to visit if you are interested in history and architecture.\n* **Modena:** This city is known for its balsamic vinegar and its Ferrari museum.
