I wouldn\u2019t bother trying to book in advance. There is only one direct train a day from FCO to Napoli Central that leaves at 9:38. So unless your flight lands at least 2-3 hours before that you will likely have to go to Roma Termini first. The Frecce trains leave frequently from Termini (like half hour or less) and are usually not full. We took the train to Florence through Termini once, and although seems counterintuitiv\ne, I\u2019d take a taxi, Uber or car service to Termini. The Leonardo express station is at terminal 3, so if you arrive at one of the other terminals you have to get there first. Unless things have changed, we had a really long walk to get to our transfer\u2026pullin\ng our suitcase. A car will let you off in front and it is much easier to get to buy your ticket and get to your binario to Naples Centrale.

As of yet I haven\u2019t done any of those travellings, I\u2019m planning to do in the next following year or two or more. I\u2019ve only been to two small trips to my neighbouring countries, one of which is across the Baltic Sea. The best conclusion I\u2019ve gathered from them is that I don\u2019t like trips that are widely popularised by Western tourists - that is, fly somewhere by plane, sleep in a hotel, see some landmarks in a stereotypically touristic fashion. I\u2019ve noticed that this doesn\u2019t bring me enough satisfaction and decided that if I want to do some travelling I would like to try make it a one big long trip, where I would explore most of the continent on a single trip, using the cheapest possible means. For example, sleeping using couchsurfing services, or maybe at hostel, travelling to places using hitchhiking or trains (also try to not use airplanes at all), seeing some landmarks and, most importantly, getting to know local people and their mentality, views on their country as well as how they tent to live everyday. All this in the cheapest possible way since my expectations of comfort at minimum at best. I\u2019m myself perfectly healthy as well as rather athletic, that\u2019s why rather running around the cities I want to explore rather than walking is more suitable for me - almost exploring like some sandbox video game character.\n\nMy questions about all these are as following:\n1. I\u2019m currently planning to go on my planned trip around Europe during the warm months, mainly from the end of April to the beginning of October. Do you think that much time is a good idea, or is it unnecessary long and maybe a three month time during college student summer vacation, from the beginning of June to the end of September.\n2. What should I provide for myself to be comfortable exploring such terrains on foot? As of now I know I should get:\n\n- An EKUZ to be eligible for a healthcare in the countries of the European Union.\n- A passport if I\u2019m travelling to a country which is outside the European Union, as long as I\u2019m staying in the EU, my home country ID card is enough. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n- From what I\u2019ve read, the mobile internet data is available without the need of buying a separate SIM cart, as long as I\u2019m still in the countries of the EU. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong about this information.\n- A budget of \u20ac EUR money. I\u2019m planning on having it mainly through credit card as well as having little in cash. Do You have any recommendations on a credit card provider companies, which would be the best for a trip I\u2019m planning?\n- A couch surfing app. As of yet, I haven\u2019t used any of such apps, that\u2019s why I would like to ask You, which app would You recommend as the best.\n- An Interrail/Eurail train ticket pass of a certain amount of days available to use throughout a month or months. Is there any more providers of such tickets or these two are the only ones? Which one for me, an European citizen would be the best?\n\nI\u2019m sorry for such a lengthy post, however I wanted to ensure You that I do not have the faintest idea about providing for such lengthy trip. I would like to ask You for every single, even the tiniest bit of seemingly obvious information that would come in handy in terms of planning such a trip and ensuring my safety and comfort.\n\nHope Everyone understood my post.
