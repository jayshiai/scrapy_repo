You can take a direct train from Rome Termini to Pompeii Scavi station, which is the closest train station to the ruins of Pompeii. This train is only available on Sundays from July to October, and there is only one train per day. The journey time is about 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nIf you are not traveling on a Sunday, you can take a train from Rome Termini to Napoli Centrale station in Naples. From there, you can take a regional train to Pompeii Scavi station. The journey time from Rome Termini to Napoli Centrale is about 1 hour, and the journey time from Napoli Centrale to Pompeii Scavi is about 30 minutes.\n\nThere are many trains available from Rome Termini to Napoli Centrale, so you should be able to find a train that fits your schedule. The regional trains from Napoli Centrale to Pompeii Scavi are less frequent, but you should still be able to find a train that works for you.\n\nI checked the train schedules for October, and there are a few returning trains listed from Pompeii Scavi to Rome Termini. The number of returning trains will probably increase as it gets closer to October.\n\nIf you are not comfortable taking the train, you can also take a guided tour to Pompeii from Rome. There are many different tour companies that offer guided tours to Pompeii, and some of them even offer transportation from Rome to Pompeii.\n\nHere are some tips for taking a day trip to Pompeii from Rome by train:\n\n* Book your train tickets in advance, especially if you are traveling on a Sunday.\n* Allow plenty of time for travel, especially if you are taking the train from Rome Termini to Napoli Centrale and then the regional train to Pompeii Scavi.\n* Wear comfortable shoes, as you will be doing a lot of walking at Pompeii.\n* Bring sunscreen and a hat, as it can be hot in Pompeii in October.\n* Pack a water bottle, as there are no water fountains at Pompeii.\n* Be prepared to wait in line, as Pompeii can be very crowded, especially in October.\n\nI hope this helps!"}, {"username": "Dann Hrusch", "comment_text": "I randomly picked 10/17 and there's at least one return train every hour until 9:00pm.

Little purchases like gelato, cheese and crackers at the market, etc. We also had some arranged transfers/cabs that were to be paid locally in cash.\n2- I used Omio for 2 of our trains and Italo\u2019s site for the third. All electronic tickets, zero problems with any of the trips.\n3- Everybody says there are water fountains everywhere, but we actually had to really look for them at times. That said, I filled my bottle with tap water when needed and that was good, too.\n4- If you have any opportunity to stay at the Il Falconiere, do it. Our stay there for the cooking school was the highlight of our trip.\n5-I\u2019m not super into museums, so while I saw all the highlights/main attractions, simply getting the skip-the-line, self-guided tour worked well for us at some places.\n6- I highly recommend Turtle Tours Rome at Night by Golf Cart tour.

So you could take two taxis. (Which is what I would do.) There are a few larger taxis but they tend to be more costly so you might spend as much on a larger taxi or on a van as you would on two regular size taxis. But if you absolutely have to have one vehicle I\u2019d reserve it in advance somewhere because there aren\u2019t many bigger vehicles.\n\nI myself would not take the train with a large suitcase. It\u2019s slower and stressful. You have to get yourself to the train station carrying your bags even before you board the train so that\u2019s extra time right there. And maneuvering luggage through cobblestone streets is no fun at all so you may need a taxi just to get you to the station. In that case you\u2019ll have the two taxi dilemma anyway, plus the cost of those taxis in addition to the cost of four train tickets. And you have to lug your cases up and down steps into and out of the train car. Then you mention \u201criskier.\u201d It\u2019s always more risky anywhere to carry luggage on public transportation than on a taxi.\n\nYou could always ask your hotel to make your transportation arrangements to the airport for you. They do that often so they usually have arrangements with reliable companies. Or at least ask them for an estimate of the cost. Because they\u2019ll have current, up to date info.\n\nIn my opinion money spent on making things easier is money well spent. I think springing for two taxis is the easiest option here. So I\u2019d gladly pay the cost if two taxis to avoid stress.\n\nAnd in my opinion I think the fear of \u201cunscrupulous\u201d taxi drivers is exaggerated. Taxis fares are regulated by law in Rome. So just be sure you take a white taxi with the official Rome logo on the door. It will have a meter and the drivers license number will be displayed inside along with a telephone number to call in case you suspect wrongdoing. And keep in mind that sometimes tourists mistake things. Tourists at times think a taxi driver is going out of the way in order to boost the fare. But in reality given the maze like nature of the streets in Rome you actually might have to go east to get to the west. And taxi companies keep the drivers updated on congestion so a driver may very well take what seems to be a roundabout way to get around a traffic jam instead of driving into a back up. It\u2019s a shame when an effort to keep the fare down results in an oblivious tourist accusing the driver of deception!\n\nSo I\u2019d say that in general you don\u2019t have to worry too much about the taxis if you take an official taxi."}, {"username": "Eva Salas", "comment_text": "I think it\u2019s posted on the door. 50.

Some of the gas stations are interesting but you can always find one where someone will pump your gas. Parking spaces are 2\" smaller than whatever car you're getting.
