We were in an Airbnb in Fontane Bianche, south of Siracusa in Sicily on June 23 when it was broken into and robbed of all our cash and valuables. We went to the police station (called 112 over five times and no one answered the phone) and made a denuncia. The host of the house came to the station as well and we asked if the house had ever been broken into. He said it had, but it was years ago. He never told us that, nor were there any security measures in place; no cameras, secure locks (we had keys) or a safe in the house.\n\nThis weekend I received a message from someone who is currently staying in the house and he told me HE HAD BEEN ROBBED AS WELL! That is two robberies in less than three weeks! When asked, the host told the current guests that the house had been robbed years ago. He did not mention us nor did he tell the police about our burglary! I also don\u2019t understand how the police can show up to an address and not have it flagged in their system that a crime had occurred in the same place at least twice.\n\nThe current guest and I are in contact and are considering how to proceed.\n\nI am sharing our story as a warning to others. If you have been a victim of a burglary in this house, or one of the houses this company represents, please contact me.\n\nAnd by the way, this house is completely booked this summer and still available for rent.\n\nGrazie!\n\nhttps://abnb.me/4P82aSrVSBb\n\nhttps://www.syrakus-homes.com/index.php", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2203766083355803/", "likes": 18, "comments": [{"username": "Selene Oliver", "comment_text": "Maybe it\u2019s the owner of the house that is doing the robbing\u2026 I lived in Italy for awhile and one thing you\u2019ll find out very quickly is that they do not work or operate the way we do here in the USA\u2026 which means you\u2019ll get little to no help from them.
