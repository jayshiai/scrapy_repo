I perused restaurants and made reservations easily. Download it.\n\n-I never once had an issue with needing a toilet, so The Flush app was pointless for me.\n\n-GoogleTranslate - a perk, even after my year of learning Italian.\n\n-FreeNow - Lifesaver!!!! For taxis in Rome area.\n\n-GO to Emma Pizzeria and do not ask questions. And then go again. \ud83d\ude30 AMAZING. PS - I did lunch both times; might be ideal to make a reservation. Eat from the seasonal menu. Also Mazz\u00e8 - make a rez.\n\n-Trenitalia App - Used to book all of my train tickets. FYI - I found the best luck on choices the morning of the day prior. I tried one day-of morning and was looking looking at later afternoon. A previous post had me navigating the train stations easily!\n\n-Visit the Farmacias for the BEST cosmetic goods! Happy to add more if interested. Here are two vids that did not steer me wrong! LOVE what I got! PS - also snagged some mini nail polish that lasted forevvvver.\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT88TXBX9/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT88Ttrvj/\n\n-In Florence, visit Ugo Poggi Firenze for antiques. The oldest in the area. I got a silver ring and custom set of glasses. If you have something in mind (or don\u2019t! in my case), they are so patient.\n\n-In Florence, there was a TON of shopping around - high-end, mainstream, etc. Dare I say almost a bit too commercialized in some areas?\n\n-Florence: pack your patience (and water!) and head to Piazzale Michelangelo. You will overlook the entire city. It was breathtaking (literally\u2026aside from being 97 and sunny when I did it). You won\u2019t regret it. Worst case, you can barrel roll down the hills/steps to return to civilization. (JK)\n\n-PLEASE go to Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella in Florence. It meets luxury cosmetics/candles, etc. and mini museum. And by luxury, I mean quality but you will not spend too much at all. I snagged a rose water and lip moisturizer because .. why not, and I spent $50 euro?\n\n-If you decide to impulsively get a tattoo in Florence, check out Florence Tattoo Studio and message them a day in advance. They were fun and my work is great!\n\n-Wherever you go, when lunch hits, grab a sandwich at a local shop and then grab a stool on the road and enjoy. One of my favorite parts of the trip.\n\n-If traveling soon, YES, it is HOT. I am used to hot, but not HUMID in Colorado where I live. My neck fan was amazing. While it could be my perimenopause \ud83d\ude05 it was spi\ufffciiicy, even in the FCO airport. My thicker thighs never suffered with some lightweight spanx. I sweat non-stop. My afternoons, I took a break and would relax or take a cold shower.\n\n-I saw another post recently about \u201cbegging\u201d for water..I never once had this happen. I always had euros on me and there are stands alllll over the place. Bottles were typically 1 euro, 1.50 at most. Plus..the fountains?\n\n-Caution: This only happened in Reggio Emilia. Following a LARGE scale concert, the city was not equipped and gridlocked for hours. I understand. However when I finally got a cab (about 4:30a) to my lodging about 15mins outside of town, I had a touchy-feely driver who grabbed at my thighs and went in for more as I paid for my ride. I was able to fend off, but unsettling nonetheless. Given that, if traveling solo - an AirTag is great, as is a personal alarm device like Birdie. All that said, I did NOT feel uncomfortable even once in more populated areas.\n\nLodging - FYI: every hotel had AC and hair dryer if that\u2019s your thing!\n\nRome: Unahotels Trestevere Roma - Great!! Rooftop bar is lovely, although the staff can be a bit lagging.\n\nReggio Emilia: Hotel La Vecchia Reggio - this place was so quaint. It was more remote than I\u2019d choose, but hotels were entirely sold out because of the concert. I loved it here.\n\nFlorence: Hotel Perseo - I LOVED this spot. It\u2019s quite compact but for 1-2, it is lovely (perhaps larger for more accommodation!) I felt like I was staying with a friend. Breakfast was especially special - you could just tell the extra care.\n\nRome (again): Hotel Ripa - Eh. Just avoid. They really want to be legit, but they are not. You enter to some fancy art installations and then enter your room and it looks like someone had a frat party and forgot to clean. Little basics were dirty - mirror, sink, around toilet, eh. The bar/restaurant was fine during happy hour, but when arriving back with a colleague at 10:45, they said no to a glass of wine (not table service) at closing time 11p.\n\nRandom Thoughts:\n\n-I packed a carry-on backpack (BEST choice) with just three outfits, plus a tote and cross-body purse. I also packed laundry detergent sheets to wash along the way and rewore (is that a word?) outfits/mixed and matched. It was great!\n\n-Ultimately I snagged a carry-on suitcase from a stand/vendor on the street. Worth the $35 to pack my stuff that was above 3.5oz to the US.\n\n-I bought Skechers sneakers and put some inserts in those babies and I was golden! Sure, my feet were tired from 7+ miles a day but never sore, blistered, etc. And I bought no-show socks with the little padding around the heel. Perfect.\n\n-Portable chargers! I brought two and they came in handy. I brought along my own converter but had a hell of a time. It would charge a few percentage and get too hot. I ended up at an Apple Store and just bought a local charger. Worth it!\n\nAll that said, if you can take the solo trip, do it!!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2203316016734143/", "likes": 85, "comments": [{"username": "Patrice Warren", "comment_text": "Thanks so much for the info!

To start, Devin met us at the Rialto Bridge, then took us on a wonderful tour of the back streets and canals, sharing his passion for his amazing city. He pointed out details, gave us insight to Venetians, and willingly answered any and all questions we asked. As we went around this \"hidden\" Venice, he would point out things we might have missed, and he would have us stop so he could take awesome photos of us together, as well as, some of me individually. We eventually got to a spot where he had a gondola waiting for us, with a gondolier and a bottle of Prosecco. We were treated to a fantastic private ride, including going on The Grand Canal, and some quiet canals, while Devin continued taking photos. When we returned from our lovely trip, Devin suggested a restaurant nearby for dinner, and we had a fabulous meal, where we were well taken care of by the owner. If you are looking for a wonderful souvenir or gift from your time in Venice, I highly recommend Devin!

Maybe you sleep better on planes than I do and maybe you have a shorter commute\u2026?\nAlso, does your air bnb allow you to check in early? Every air bnb I\u2019ve stayed in, check in is like no earlier than 3pm\u2026 so not sure how you will get all the rest of the stuff done on your itinerary on day 1.

It's not worth it to stay less than 2 nights anywhere. Watch a travelog to see all those things. Experiencing Italy is much more the taking a quick pic of a site.

You\u2019ll wear yourself down trying to do all this in 1/2 days. We stayed in Rome for 4 days and still didn\u2019t see everything. I would do the Trevi fountain and Spanish steps at night. My husband and I did that by mistake and it turned out to be one of the most magical nights in Rome.\n\nDay 1: Colosseum, Forum, Pantheon.\n\nDay 1 night: Trevi fountain and Spanish steps\n\nDay 2: Vatican City/Sistine Chapel\n\nYou could possibly catch the high speed train after your Vatican City tour but you\u2019ll certainly be extremely tired.
