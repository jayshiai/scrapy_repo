Can't wait to go back again soon hopefully! Several days with my family on the Italian Riviera, one week at an agriturismo in Tuscany and a few days in Rome. This group was very helpful and informative and I appreciate this group and its invaluable resource. Let me know if I can answer any questions!\nI have a couple tips that I don't recall seeing on here related to driving. We rented a car in Tuscany. Picked it up in Rapallo on the coast and dropped it off at Termini Station in Rome.\n-My credit card didn't work at gas stations for some reason.Everywhere else, no problem.\nI speak some Italian and study it on my own but late at night I had forgotten that gasolio is diesel. Benzina is regular gas. I realized i made this mistake late at night after putting in my cash and before filling the car with it (diesel was written on the actual gas nozzle).\nTo pay by cash or card, it is standalone and not on each pump and you select the pump on the spot after making your payment.\nOften there is no gas attendant at all on site. If you make a mistake on which pump you selected after inserting cash, there does not appear to be a way to cancel and get your cash back. You will get a receipt with a code stating amount paid and amount of gas received. In my case it was 0 received. There may be a code on the receipt to enter on the pump for a credit. Then you can use the credit to fill your tank.\nI had a couple issues trying to figure out the whole gas thing and was delighted that someone spent about 15 minutes trying to help me ( in Italian) which I understood a decent amount but not 100%. Not to scare anyone. Just be prepared. It would have helped me to know these things up front.\nDriving on the highway during the day was fine but at night is different from the US. No street lights in many cases, lots of curves, tunnels and in my case, some major construction on the A1 from Florence to Val d'Orcia in the south of Tuscany. I would definitely drive in Tuscany but preferably not at night on the major highways if I have a choice.\nAlso, I found the following site to be very helpful, especially the information on driving in Italy - https://mominitaly.com/driving-in-italy\nWe did various activities, touring around and relaxing and enjoying the moment and had a wonderful and memorable stay.\nAll in all, I am in love with this beautiful country and its people and looking forward to coming back again soon!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2209005392831872/", "likes": 40, "comments": [{"username": "Scott Heran", "comment_text": "We also were confused about the petrol stations.

The Academia has some interesting things, but it was built to showcase the David, so that is the focus of most visitors. The Uffizi is huge, and personally, I needed several visits to really take it all in. Borghese is a good size, good variety and the building itself is an art piece.

Just like others on this page have said, just keep an eye on your stuff like you normally would in a big city, and you\u2019ll be okay. Even in alleys where theres less tourists, I have yet to see a single local look sketchy and try something with me (traveling on my own). Because of this, I did decide to keep my passport on me at all times too just in case its needed!\n\n- Crowds: honestly not as bad as this page made it out to be. Not sure if its just less tourists in general right now, but its definitely manageable. Didnt feel like cattle/so tightly packed in like I thought I would be lol. Even at the Trevi Fountain, it seems like a regular crowd for a tourist attraction in the states.\n\n- Temps: not too bad either!! The forecast does say it\u2019ll be in the 90s later this week so I may change how I feel then lol but so far its been mid 80s and feels fine. A nice breeze in the morning, but then is full sunny hot weather from 11am to sunset. Veryy similar to Chicago summers. Walk near shade, use sunscreen, bring a fan, DRINK WATER.\n\nwill update if anything changes, but its been a great trip so far \ud83d\ude42", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2209734379425640/", "likes": 79, "comments": [{"username": "Nicole Gouzoules Sheehan", "comment_text": "We just returned from a wonderful trip to Rome.

A quick recap below:\n\nFlorence, Day 1.\n\nLanded in Rome.\nBeautiful car drove us to train.\nMade it to Florence.\nPromptly went exploring\u2026the streets, the people, the vibe is like nothing we have ever experienced. Beautiful and passionate and hot and stunning mixed together with delicious gelato and a cafe for Prosecco.\n\nEnded with dinner at Osteria Pastella -\nBlown away.\n\nFirst full day in Italy did not disappoint.\n\nNext up, a 10 hour tour.\n\nFirst stop, Pisa.\n\nNext stop, San Gimignano. Gelato and exploring.\n\nNext stop, Tuscany. Lunch and wine tasting at the Palagetto winery - owned by a 29 year old woman.\n\nNext stop, a castle in Monteriggoni. Very cool. Built during the war between Florence and Sienna which lasted 300 years.\n\nLast stop, Sienna. A beautiful city with all red bricks (hence the name).\n\nEnded the day with the most delicious pizza.\n\nNext, day of art.\nFirst stop, a guided tour of the Accademia Gallery. The art was so beautiful it left me breathless. The statue of David is a sight to see. 15 feet tall and a true work of God.\n\nNext, a 2 hour walking tour all through Florence.\n\nNext, a guided tour at the Uffizi museum. Ended up being private as the other group never showed. You can spend days exploring every room in that museum. My favorite was da Vinci and Michelangelo.\n\nNext stop, a wonderful leather store. The owner was so kind. I bought a beautiful leather jacket and bag.\n\nNext stop, gelato.\n\nEnded the night with dinner at Trattoria Zaza. Delicious.\n\n20,000+ steps later, we are exhausted and happy.\n\nDay number 4 landed us in Rome!\n\nAfter a dicey start (we got off at the wrong train station in Rome and got a bit turned around), we made our way to the hotel.\n\nChecked in and began a 2.5 hour walk around Rome. Trevi Fountain was beautiful, a quick lunch, gelato and more exploring.\n\nMade our way to the Argo Di Costantino for a tour of the Palatine Hill, Roman Forum and Colosseum. Breathtaking, all of it.\n\nSweaty and exhausted but quick showers and dinner in Trastevere - a delicious restaurant called Tonnarello. Gelato again.\n\nFinally, rooftop for sunset.\n\nDay two in Rome did not disappoint!!\n\nBreakfast at the hotel (cappuccino & croissant!)\n\nBegan our journey walking and ended up at the Spanish Steps.\n\nFrom there, stumbled upon the Pantheon and ended up grabbing a light lunch at a cafe looking straight at it - what a sight!\n\nFrom there we made our way to the Vatican. On a tour, we were guided through the Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel & St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. It was quite powerful.\n\nEnded the night in the Jewish Ghetto - a really beautiful part of the city. Dinner at Giggetto al portico d'Ottavia - Josh\u2019s favorite meal so far.\n\nEnded our time in Rome.\n\nCar to train station.\nTrain to Naples.\nCar to Positano (winding & on a cliff)\n\n\u2026and made it to this magical place that exists in fairytales.\n\nLunch at our beautiful hotel, relaxing and watching a movie and dinner at Chez Black (a 20 minute walk down a massive hill - and back up after, slowly, while stopping for gelato).\n\nA full day in Positano.\n\nStarted the day off with a sunrise photoshoot - the sweetest photographer from @flytographer. https://l.instagram.com/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pierpaoloperri.com%2F&e=AT2kJSbJ2MBt6itMq0ZsDAvIfbjQhQNE2mCjvNNCk7vH24ogPI2jhcCxnt-jQJfo5CEdo3Q-C9GYIxgwPa29BXZodi53eK2gRhzX\n\nSpent all day at La Scolgliera Beach Club (there is a very small public beach, otherwise you rent chairs, which include water, an umbrella and super comfy seats).\n\nDinner at D\u2019Aiello Ristorante.\n\nPositano. I \ud83e\ude77 you.\n\nBeach Club at a secret hidden beach we found through a cave.\n\nDinner at Il Capitano - a glass balcony overlooking the most beautiful view.\n\nLast day, traveling back to Rome - ended with shopping and dinner at Enzo, YUM!!!\n\nOverall, best trip!!!!
