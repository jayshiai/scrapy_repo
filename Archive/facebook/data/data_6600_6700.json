The second day was our food tour we had Giada who took us to all the best local traditional foods of Venice we tried the fried mozzarella sandwich, gnocchi, gelato, cheeses and pastries.\n\nI think the best thing about withlocals is that it is intimate. You book a guide and they cater to you. You are not surrounded by strangers and can go off the beaten path if you ask.\n\nWe asked to go to a different spot and Giada took us.

You can rent vespas/scooters, electric bikes but I\u2019ve never been so scared to drive anywhere. Watch-out as a pedestrian because every driver is in a hurry.

I purchased an international phone plan but many times the maps wouldn\u2019t load and I got lost and very confused. It is July and so very hot.\n\nTip #3- Make sure to drink plenty of water and have a refillable water bottle. There are some free water fountains but they are few and far between. Water in restaurants is not free.\n\nTip #4- if you do take a taxi try to use your google map as we quickly learned some drivers like taking the long long long way around.\n\nTip #5- Be cautious of pickpockets, and beggars they sometimes work together to distract you.

No need for a travel agent as they will direct you to touristy places and events.\nWhen Florence, you must take the local bus to Fisiole where the panoramic views of the city are spectacular. Rome is huge, diverse and overwhelming. You need to pick a central location and take day trips from there. I recommend Trastevere .\nVenice is a one time experience. I suggest staying in Murano, a small island in Venice. Make sure you pack already worn in comfortable shoes, function over fashion. You will get rain, but it won\u2019t be cold. Ask locals for family owned restaurants off the touristy zone. Go to open Mercados for food and snacks and leather product to cut down on restaurant expenses. Make sure you have a mini fridge for your wine and snacks\ud83d\ude0d\nAlso make sure your banks are notified as your atm withdrawals and card charges will look like fraud and will be declined. Don\u2019t carry excessive cash and never wear a backpack unless it\u2019s facing forward. Theft is no joke. Download a translator on your phone to make communication easier and Italians enjoy your efforts to speak their language even though in large cities, they speak English.
