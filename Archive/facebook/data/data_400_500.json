I was thinking we should splurge on the private taxi but not sure. I had this vision that maybe if we booked private, we could get an english speaking 'driver' who could tell us something about the sites as we went to our hotel. Kind of like a mini\u0906\u0923\u0916\u0940 tour to go with it. Has anyone had that experience?\nDoes the private water taxi go up the grand canal just like the vaporettos? If the 'driver' (what's the proper name here) doesn't speak to us, and we're just enjoying the view, would it be much difference between a private boat and the public vaporetto?\n\nThanks in advance.

In May, crowds will not be too great. Walk higher up into the towns for restaurants etc. 6 days a lot but You can easily fill the week. take ferry to Sorrento 1 day. Go to cheese making and olive oil farm above Sorrento then pizza making class. A blast!!! Another day take ferry to Amalfi then bus/taxi up to Ravello. 3rd day hire a private boat to go to Prochida or Ischia and sightsee along the coast and take trip around Capri. 4th day, take ferry to Capri and explore and go up to Annacapri and have lunch at Michaelangelo. One morning hike the path of the Gods above Positano. Or/and go the Pompeii and stop for lunch at winery at base if Vesuvius.
