In Italy, the local currency is Euros.\n\nIf you pay in cash, you\u2019ve already paid any currency exchange costs at the time you converted your money.\n\nIf you use a credit card (and I think withdrawing cash from an atm on your debit card as well), you will often see the option to pay in local currency, or converted to the currency of your own country.\n\nIn both cases, your credit card statement will be updated in the currency of your country (euro x exchange rate + any possible exchange fees).\n\nIf you choose to pay in local currency, you are charged in euros and all that stuff happens whenever the charge lands on your statement. That could be several days after the original transaction, at whatever exchange rate is in effect on the day/time it lands.\n\nIf you choose to pay in converted currency, you are charged in your own currency, based on whatever the exchange was at the time of the transaction.\n\nSince markets are volatile and can fluctuate many times during a day, you could be paying a higher rate for a 9am transaction versus a 6pm transaction.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not 100% sure on this but I think \u2018pay in converted $\u2019 may have a hidden fee built in, which makes it look like a higher exchange rate has been charged.\n\nAnd lastly - Never use a credit card to withdraw cash from an ATM unless you understand \u2026.

We aim to cover Naples, Rome, Florence, Venice, Zurich, Lucerne and Paris. Do you think it\u2019s better to purchase the Eurail pass or is it better to purchase train tickets for each destination\u0906\u0923\u0916\u0940 separately? Also, do train tickets need to be purchased in advance or on the day of travel is fine? Last question, is there a huge difference in comfort between regular train tickets and the business class?

We bought first class because we did 4 high speed trains. Some trains you can\u2019t even tell what is first class - in France - but there are more seats usually in first class.

We have the 7 travel days in 30 days pass."}, {"username": "Fetchin Gretchen", "comment_text": "You did not say how long your trip was but here are some answers to your questions.\n\n* **Eurail pass vs. individual train tickets:** If you're planning on doing a lot of train travel, a Eurail pass can be a great way to save money. However, it's important to do the math to make sure that it's actually worth it for your specific trip. You can use the Eurail pass calculator to help you figure out if it's the right option for you.\n* **Purchasing train tickets:** If you're not going to get a Eurail pass, you'll need to purchase train tickets for each destination separately. You can usually buy tickets online or at the train station, though I prefer the trainline app myself If you're traveling during peak season, it's a good idea to book your tickets in advance, especially for popular routes like Rome to Florence.\n* **Comfort level:** There is a difference in comfort between regular train tickets and business class. Business class tickets usually include things like reserved seats, more legroom, and access to a lounge. If you're traveling with a large group, business class tickets can be a good way to ensure that you all have seats together and that you have enough space for your luggage.\n* **Getting on and off trains:** Trains in Europe usually stop for a few minutes at each station. This should be enough time to board and disembark with your luggage, even if you're traveling in a large group. However, it's a good idea to be prepared and have your tickets and luggage ready before the train arrives.\n\nI hope this helps!"}, {"username": "Grace Scinto", "comment_text": "You\u2019re covering the same route we did but we also went to London.
