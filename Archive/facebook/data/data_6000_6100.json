Is it a good idea to get seats by the luggage area to keep an eye on your bags?\n\nWe\u0906\u0923\u0916\u0940 are taking backpack carryons with most of what we need packed in them, but also will take one checked bag for things we may buy. That way any lost luggage is on the way over is no big deal. But is there room at out seats for our carryons?\n\nWe will be there mid September so I imagine we should take short sleeve and capris style with maybe one light jacket?", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2195407627524982/", "likes": 14, "comments": [{"username": "Lynn Crane", "comment_text": "I'm not sure about coach, but my husband and I bumped to business on Frecciarosa and had plenty of luggage space overhead and at our feet.

We visited Paris, Venice, Florence, Pisa, Cinque Terre, Amalfi, Capri, Pompeii and Rome.\nThis group was so helpful in my planning, I thought I would give back by sharing my tips. I have so much to share that I\u2019ve broken up my posts into Packing, Travel with Kids, and Itinerary Highlights. So here are my tips for:\n\n\nITINERARY HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\nVenice\nOur first stop in Italy. We toured the Jewish Ghetto, visited St. Mark\u2019s Square and St. Mark\u2019s Basilica, took the Doge\u2019s Palace Secret Itineraries Tour and went on a gondola ride.\nThis is where \u2013 on our FIRST day in Italy, my kids informed me that they\u2019re OVER museums and cathedrals and don\u2019t want to learn anything. First day.\nSo\u2026I think the biggest highlight for the kids was aimless travel on the water taxis. I say \u201caimless\u201d because I cannot, for the life of me, read the water taxi map. I think one would need to speak fluent Italian plus have a degree in Advanced Nautical Navigation to figure out how to get from point A to point B. Luckily, we got the unlimited 48-hour travel card for 30 Euro, made sure to validate it, and then just rode it around until we got tired and meandered back to our place. It was perfect.\nBTW, since arriving back home, I\u2019ve learned that there are viral TikTok videos of a woman in Venice screaming ATTENZIONE PICKPOCKET!! at would-be thieves. I should note that we didn\u2019t see any pick-pocketers while we were there, but I\u2019m kind of sad we didn\u2019t see the woman, as she\u2019s my new hero (And I\u2019d also love to ask her what brand of caffeine she drinks)\n\n\nCinque Terre:\nWe used this website https://gangwaze.com/cruise-port-traffic\nto figure out which cruise ports would be busiest when, and then set our itinerary for Cinque Terre when the cruise traffic in that location was at a minimum. It worked really well as we had minimal crowds.\nOn our first day, we hiked from Corniglia to Vernazza. We went early (maybe 8 or 9am?) and the path was almost entirely empty, and then got increasingly busy as the day went on.\nOn our second day, we took the Cinque Terre train to Levanto and rented bikes, then rode on the converted 19thcentury railway track through tunnels to Framura. It was a flat 1-hour flat ride with amazing views and no crowds. I HIGHLY recommend this and thank whoever in this group suggested it.\n(One point of note: Levanto shops and restaurants close for their midday \u201criposo\u201d. We learned this the hard way when we showed up at 1pm and everything was closed. Google is of no help in this matter, and will claim that the completely dark, boarded up bicycle shop you\u2019re standing in front of is actually open! Avoid the inevitable argument with your spouse and visit Levanto either in the morning or after 3pm.)\n\n\nFlorence\nI really enjoyed and would recommend the Uffizi and L\u2019Accademia Galleries. There\u2019s also The Duomo, whose dome is an architectural and engineering marvel. We got tickets to climb the dome, and let me just say that I felt like an Olympian by the time I finished scaling the 400+ steps in the midday Tuscan heat. While taking in the sight of all of Florence laid out before my feasting eyes and waiting the 40 minutes to catch my breath, some of my guilt about my daily repeated intake of gelato, Nutella and all-carbohydrate pasta-and-white-bread dinners melted away. My kids enjoyed the Duomo and Bell Tower climbs a lot more than the art museums.\n\n\nPisa\nYou won\u2019t be shocked to read that the highlight of our half-day in Pisa was climbing the Leaning Tower and also coming up with silly pictures of ourselves manipulating the tower in ways that didn\u2019t include the hundreds of other people ALSO pretending to manipulate the tower for photos. Beholding the landscape, I was just as moved by the Leaning Tower as the scene of people half-frozen in their poses. We all looked like some horrifying combination of Twister and freeze-dance. I cannot fathom what aliens would think of our civilization if they visited Pisa on any given day.\n\n\nCapri\nIn Capri, we rented a private boat through Viator (Tour operator: We Capri), and I could see the pain in our captain\u2019s eyes when we told him we wanted to go to The Blue Grotto. I used to live in NYC and exhibited the same anguished expression whenever out of town guests wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty. But our captain very kindly obliged and after warning us that the wait time could be 1 \u2013 2 hours of pure motor-fuel scented misery, he piloted our boat to the Grotto, and voila, it wasn\u2019t actually that busy. After 40 mins, we got our 5 minutes inside the Grotto and then toured the rest of the island. I think it\u2019s a bit of a crapshoot whether it\u2019ll be crowded but maybe it helped that we went on the early side and it was early June.\nAlso \u2013 and I know this is going to cause some controversy, but I have to say it \u2013 the best gelato of the entire trip that I had was in Capri. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t remember the name of this place, so mystified was I by this marvelous, velvety substance melting on my taste buds that I wandered around in a stupor. The best directions I can tell you are to take the Funicular up and go to the gelato place across from the statue of the naked woman. I\u2019m totally serious.\n\n\nAmalfi\nDo not go here if you\u2019re allergic to lemons, hate the smell of lemons, have an unspecified aversion to lemons or are triggered by lemons in any way. I had no idea about the lemon thing before we showed up. Our place was right above lemon orchards, and I started to get the hint while showering with lemon-shaped soap after enjoying lemon-balls while drinking limoncello. By the end of your time here, you\u2019ll be dreaming of lemons. I even broke down on the last day and bought a lemon-patterned dress. Why? I have no idea.\nOh right \u2013 itinerary highlights. If you don\u2019t mind climbing A LOT, there\u2019s a cantaloupe-themed (ha! Totally kidding!) lemon-themed restaurant. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so useless with names but it\u2019s basically up the big hill and keep climbing (en route to the Valle dell Ferriere Nature Preserve). Once you\u2019re dripping with sweat and questioning your decision to listen to me, you\u2019ve arrived! It has 2 patios and around 6 delicious menu items that are all made from lemons.\nAlso, in Amalfi, we rented a private boat from a captain named Sergio, whose info I can pass along to whoever would like. He was great and took us on a 7-hour tour of the Amalfi coast. I could detect his great sense of relief when we told him we\u2019d already been to the Blue Grotto and didn\u2019t desire to go back. His boat wasn\u2019t huge (in fact, the WeCapri boat was bigger) but reasonably fit the 5 of us.\n\n\nPompeii\nMost of the places we visited, we took small-group tours, but in Pompeii I booked a private tour that billed itself as \u201cchild friendly\u201d. I booked through Viator and the local company is Italy Tours for Kids. This tour cost more than the others, but I booked it because my twelve-year old boy\u2019s eyes welled up at the idea of seeing plaster casts made from the remains of deceased Pompeiians. I tried to remind him that Mt. Vesuvius erupted over two thousand years ago, and the Pompeiians would all be dead anyway \u2013 possibly in even more tragic and horrific ways \u2013 but for some reason, that didn\u2019t make him feel any better.\nOur tour guide was named Rossana, and she was amazing. She was engaging, she asked the kids questions, she weaved video and photos in with her dialogue to keep it interesting. She was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. I highly recommend.\n\n\nRome\nAh, Rome. If you had asked me before we got to Rome about our experience, I would have said that everything was perfect. Perfect weather, perfect lodging, perfect food, perfect itinerary. Then we got to Rome, and, let me just say that this is where our luck ran out. About everything.\nI\u2019ve already written another post about our lodging in Trastavere. I recommend staying at our place only if you like dysfunctional air-conditioning and a nonstop nighttime jamboree at decibel ten. Interestingly, some of the commenters did say THIS SOUNDS PERFECT FOR ME! And asked for the lodging details. So I guess one man\u2019s exasperating, expletive-laden nighttime torture chamber is another man\u2019s treasure.\nNow, let\u2019s move to the weather. I find The Weather Channel app to be incredibly accurate here in the States. But apparently this technology can\u2019t be replicated for Italy. The Weather app predicted rain for most of the time we were in Italy, and we didn\u2019t get so much as an overnight sprinkle. Temps were in the 70s and sunshine was abundant. My husband and I kept saying to each other, Wow we are SO lucky! Then we got to Rome, where ALL THE RAIN we were supposed to get the previous three weeks CAME DOWN AT ONCE. We were on a Rome Street Food Tour and soon became saturated and blinded by the torrential downpour. For the three days we were in Rome, it rained 50 \u2013 60% of the time.\nAnd\u2026the food. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s hard to find a bad meal in Italy, but leave it to my resourceful family to find one. We decided to try out a vegan restaurant that claimed to not have any common allergy triggers. Well, let me be the first to caution you: NEVER be the only customers in a restaurant in the center of a crowded town! That should have been our first indicator. And the prices were sky high too, considering that there were no actual ingredients in any of the food! Umm, ATTENZIONE PICKPOCKET!! But, I guess hungry people can make poor choices, so we rapaciously gobbled up our cardboard-tasting pancakes and eggless \u201comelets\u201d and then fought each other, Roman Gladiator-style, for the prized bathrooms in our lodging. Whatever noises were going on in there were at least drowned out by the nonstop party going on outside. That\u2019s all I have to say about that.\n(And, to preface any inquiries, I don\u2019t know the name of this restaurant. We were busy and just hopped into an empty place. And PLEASE don\u2019t message me THIS SOUNDS PERFECT FOR ME! Because I will know you\u2019re trolling me and that\u2019s simply not possible!!)\nAnd, oh right, the itinerary! How could I forget about our once-in-a-lifetime Underground Colosseum tour, which we booked MONTHS in advance that got canceled four days beforehand due to a nonexistent \u201cpolitical event\u201d? My husband and I frantically searched for replacement Colosseum tours and were not surprised that everything was sold out. I called GetYourGuide in America and spoke to a representative who made good on his pledge to find our family a replacement tour. In the end, we got the Colosseum Arena floor but no Underground. Those of you who actually go on an Underground tour, please post your photos so I can simultaneously drool and weep at your good fortune.\nI don\u2019t want to paint Rome as an entirely lost cause. We did have many good times there. We really enjoyed a pizza-making class and the previously mentioned Colosseum and Street Food Tours. We climbed the Spanish Steps and threw pennies in the Trevi Fountain. We toured the Vatican, St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Pantheon and Sistine Chapel.\nSo Rome, like the rest of Italy, was filled with great times and memories. Almost all of the food was amazing, the ruins were incredible, the sights were stunning. Yes, we were happy to be back in the USA, with its prevalence of clothes dryers and predictable weather patterns. But Italy will always live in our hearts, and there\u2019s so much more to the country that we haven\u2019t explored! I\u2019m already fantasizing that my next novel will land me a book tour to such fabulous places as Sicily, Milan, Lake Como and Sorrento. And while that\u2019s basically a pipe dream, our pennies in the Trevi Fountain have superstitiously assured us that we will be back!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2195050714227340/", "likes": 774, "comments": [{"username": "Fiona Ferrar", "comment_text": "Thanks for the tip about the ports for cinque terre.

We will be visiting for about 18 days (including travel days) in the fall of \u201924. We will likely spend days 2-4 in Venice, days 5-8 in a little town south of Livorno (possibly doing 1-2 day trips: Elba, the Riviera, etc.), days 9-11 in the Val d\u2019orcia area at an agriturismo, days 12-14 in Umbria and days 15-17 in Rome. We will be renting a car for our time in Tuscany but have a few logistical questions:\nWe don\u2019t want to drive in the city centers of Florence or Rome. Where should we rent a car beginning with our time in Tuscany that will allow us to drop back off somewhere before we enter Rome? I\u2019ve been looking at the Hertz sites (and elsewhere) and have hit a roadblock.\nFor the travel between Venice and Tuscany- should we try to stop by Florence for a few hours and then try to rent a car near there and continue on our way? If so- where do we rent that won\u2019t require inner-city driving and what\u2019s the best way to get there?\nIf we were to do a daytrip to the riviera- should we drive to Livorno to park and take a train? Should we drive up to Le Spezia and then take a ferry? Which would be the most cost-effective and least-stressful way to do that?\nIf we decide to do day trips to Elba or the Riviera (on our own, not guided)- how realistic is it to decide once we arrive? We\u2019d really like this trip to be fairly relaxed so we have as little scheduled as possible and just decide as we go.\n(I realize many will say that we\u2019re cheating ourselves out of Florence- but we\u2019re truly fine with just spending an afternoon there or missing it all together. If it makes sense logistically and financially- we\u2019d like to get a glimpse and maybe stroll a neighborhood, city center, one of the gardens or libraries or maybe just see the Ponte Vecchio Bridge but we will not be touring any of the famous sites.) We\u2019re also fine just bi-passing it if it doesn\u2019t make sense. Narrowing our itinerary is difficult and we know we can\u2019t visit all of the places.

Then simply buy an open ticket for \u20ac8 for the local train between Nice & Ventimiglia at the station, no reservation necessary for these.
