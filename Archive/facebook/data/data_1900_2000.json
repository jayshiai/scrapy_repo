My husband and older son had to make their way through the museum, which was not easy because a lot of the entranceways were blocked off and it was very crowded by this point. It took them about an hour and a half (including touring Egyptian wing) just to get to the Sistine chapel, but then they were able to walk right into the Basilica, and climb the dome, and walk down and go to the graves. \ufffc\n\nSeven conclusion, if I were you, I would wait for another day as long as your hotel was close by and go right to the Basilica in the morning.
