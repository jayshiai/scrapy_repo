Many parts of Italy will be taking vacation from August 15th until the end of the month. Smaller stores and restaurants will be closed but many will be open.\n\nFirst off is accommodation. We are at Hotel Hilda which is just a few short blocks from the Duomo. We walked from the train station to the hotel in about 15 minutes with one large suitcase and a smaller one. Just watch for bikes, motorcycles, vespas and cars. The hotel is amazing with a large suite including a kitchen, nice sized bathroom, sitting area and large open bedroom. Very friendly management. Grocery stores close by for some juice, wine, breakfast options etc.\n\nSecond is restaurants. You really can have your pick of dozens of restaurants. We enjoyed the restaurant just outside our hotel that the manager recommended for both breakfast and dinner. We also dined at Trattoria ZaZa and Trattoria Dall\u2019Oste.\n\nThird is timing for meals. No problem in finding a regular breakfast of eggs or omelettes. We did tend to eat around 10 am and hold out until dinner. If you are used to eating dinner around 6 or 7 pm you will have no problem. It is much busier by 8 or 9 and you will have to wait if no reservation. We did not make reservations anywhere due to this plan.\n\nFourth. You will pay for regular \u2018still\u2019 water so you may want to let that go and either drink before you head out or bring your own. It costs anywhere from 2 to 4 euros which we found too much. Beer and wine is quite reasonable though.\n\nCooking class. There are many to choose from but we chose Small Group Pasta Class from scratch with seasonal ingredients in Florence Italy. This is a small group of only 8 people but you can get up to 12. Chef Vary was so much fun and had a wonderful way of teaching and interacting with the group. Highly recommend.\n\nDuomo. We could not get into this attraction. You should book well in advance or try lining up for hours in the hot sun. We decided to forgo this and visited other museums and historical buildings in the area. If you want a good hill to climb, check out Piazza Michaelangelo for a breathtaking view of the city. Many go there for the sunset as well.\n\nWatch out for the distractions that will lead to pick pockets. It can be someone flipping a coin and letting it drop so you pick it up or a fast chance game while someone else is patting you down. Just always be aware and don\u2019t get caught up.\n\nOtherwise we felt very safe. Husband carried wallet in front pocket and I used my purse as a cross body bag and always had zippers to the inside and one hand holding the strap. Try to use a bag with a thick strap as they are harder to cut through or grab.\n\nSafe travels and hope this helps.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2212510945814650/", "likes": 17, "comments": [{"username": "Elena Innocenti", "comment_text": "In Italy it would be forbidden to consume food or drink brought from you in a restaurant or bar.

I know some have given tips on what to look for but I\u2019m a visual person so if I had this, it would have made it a little less stressful.\n2. General picture of layout of some of the platforms.\n3. If you decide to use the bathrooms at the station, you\u2019ll have to pay 1 euro, plus side, the gates like the one shown below take credit cards (you will see a screen on the top of the metal compartment, this was the exit gate)\n4. Once you head to your platform, you\u2019ll come across these gates where you\u2019ll have to scan the QR code on your ticket to pass.\n5. On each car you\u2019ll find the train car number followed by the seats available closest to the door.\n6. We had base business seats, this was our seat space.\n7. The luggage rack above the seats was the main space I saw for storage. That white luggage is a large one and the green one is medium sized. My husband had to help another passenger put her white luggage up there because of the size and weight.\n8. Screen on the train that tells you about upcoming destinations.\nIf I\u2019ve got any information wrong, please let me know so I can edit my post.
