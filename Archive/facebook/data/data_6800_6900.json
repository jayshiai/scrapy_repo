Accusted me of leaving the place dirty, which we left so clean, we even made the beds! (I took videos) He said we left \"rubbish\" which we did leave one bag of garbage and recycleables? and completely ruined my reputation on Airbnb. He accused us of stealing 3 towels as well. There ended up being bugs in the couch but it was hard to see since it was black. I put a white pillow and then saw them, but they were not bedbugs, just bugs. Now I doubt we will use Airbnb again with our bad review. I would stay away from this listing if you are in the Trastevere area. Thanks everyone. At least I got a partial refund.\nJust arrived. Our Airbnb listing said that breakfast was included. I\u2019m a previous text he confirmed muffins, milk, coffee, juice and a few other things. He said it was all gone. There is coffee you can make and water. It said we have resort access nearby. There is no resort access. It said there is a washer and dryer. There is a compact washing machine and a dryer rack in the outside shed. It lists washer dryer and dryer rack. My last one had washer dryer and I specifically searched this filter.

European AC may be different than what some tourists expect. Having AC does not necessarily mean it will cool off places the way AC in the US, for example, does. My own Italian family does not like AC at all. They believe it causes sickness. When my Italian family visits our home in the summer they shiver from our AC. When we stay with them the experience is reversed. (But we each somehow manage to survive) I think it\u2019s entirely possible that the AC anywhere in Rome will be very similar to what this place offers.\n\nWashers and dryers also mean something completely different in Italy. That \u201ccompact\u201d washing machine is the norm there. Living spaces are much smaller in Italy so machines are designed to fit into a small space. Energy costs are also very high so the machines are designed for energy efficiency. Some of those compact washers are actually combined washer-dryer units but because energy efficiency is a priority they take hours and hours to dry clothes. So a lot of Italians just prefer to use a drying rack.\n\nNot including breakfast when the listing stated it was included isn\u2019t good, but typical Italian breakfasts usually include coffee or tea and a pastry. Large breakfasts are not a thing there. Be that as it may I don\u2019t think airbnbs typically include breakfast. Old style b and bs always include breakfast but air BnBs are a different thing.\n\nIf you feel the listing was misleading I think you should notify Airbnb immediately.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed in your accommodations.\nThat\u2019s not a good way to start your stay in Rome.

It's the owner's job to have someone come and look at the one not working. I agree with others that the AC is much different then we have here in the US (I love my AC and can sympathize with you!). Resort access is an odd listing. Does it say on the listing what is included in the resort access? I've stayed at hotels that charge a resort fee for being central to sites, but never at an airbnb. As far as the food goes, you can find a great bakery walking distance or a grocery and grab some things for the apartment. It shouldn't be listed if not included, but what can you do?\n\nThings have changed drastically with airbnb since COVID. I know its frustrating, but I think you reporting to airbnb and making sure they are looking into it will be your way of getting things resolved.

As restaurants there I recommend Al Giurista, Osteria a Priori, Stella. Good pizzerias in the area include : Marghereat, I cento Passi, Filo d'olio, Officine Bartolini.A classic local food is Torta al Testo, but don't get it at tourist chains like Il Testone, it's not worth it.
