I have a picture of her on the Spanish Steps so I went to that same spot and took one of me holding her photo. \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m traveling with my son and his girlfriend and am just so happy to be here.\n\nBecause of this site, I just booked the pasta-making class in a couple days and am looking at other ideas as well, although our itinerary is pretty full. After here, we are going to Cinque Terre, Pisa, and finally\u2014Venice. Does anyone know where I could maybe find a glass artist who would make something in glass using some of her ashes? ( i.e. paper weight? Or something like that?? )\n\nThanks in advance and here are a few photos of us and our Italian adventures so far!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2205433893189022/", "likes": 554, "comments": [{"username": "Linda Brookings Hull", "comment_text": "Thank you for the great pictures.\nSo sorry for your loss.\ud83d\ude1e"}, {"username": "Nilza Mercado", "comment_text": "I'm sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc94\nBeautiful photos!"}, {"username": "Nancy Palumbo Mazziotta", "comment_text": "Beautiful pictures."}, {"username": "Caryn Schecter Berman", "comment_text": "Beautiful photos.

I was lying in the bed, and she said she was done and needed a towel, so I sat up, and put my feet down into a LAKE on the bedroom floor.\n\nAt first I thought a bottle of water leaked in our luggage, so I ripped said luggage apart looking for it. No water in our bags. Now I look for a leak or something in the ceiling. Nope. I then realize the shower is directly on the other side of the wall from the leak, and there\u2019s water gushing out from underneath the wall, flooding the room, and soaked all of our luggage sitting there.\n\nI immediately message the host, saying we need towels to clean this up, and the wall/shower\nIs leaking, please come look.\n\nShe responds with \u201cbambino did it!!! BAMBINO no shut door\u201d. The door WAS in fact all the way shut, the bathroom floor completely dry.\n\nShe comes up stairs SCREAMING at us (all Italian, no English - which is fine), but refuses to use google translate to communicate with me, instead shouting \u201cAlora!!!\u201d Over and over and over.\n\nTHEN she walks over to my daughter and starts grabbing her by the face, still speaking frantically at her in Italian.\n\nShe then says, \u201cI knew absolutely nothing about this. No one else this ever happen to\u201d\nBullshit. And Don\u2019t touch my kid.\n\nUnfortunately it was late at night, and we needed to be up in a few hours or I would have left and got another place. Thank god we were only there for a few short hours.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2. Hotel Nord Nuova, Rome.\nThis was our second hotel in Rome at the end of our trip for one night. I needed to be close to Termini, which it is\n\nWe checked in around 9pm and headed straight out to dinner, and spend our last few hours exploring beautiful Rome. The room stunk a little, like smoke and dampness, but I thought \u201cit\u2019s just one night\u201d\n\nWe got back in around 2am, and when I went to take a shower I notice the black mold crawling up the walls and out of the ceiling, a ring around the entire bathroom. Disgusting and unacceptable.\n\nThe bed and pillows were hard as hell but we were so exhausted it really didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThe other places we stayed over the two weeks were fantastic.

It was lovely. No issues. Driving in the city was interesting but only to get to our hotels before dropping off the rental car. We drove in one day from Venice to verona to see juliet s house, then continued to maranello to see the ferrari museum. And then finally arrived in florence. My husband dropped us off at our hotel in the ztl district and then returned the car to hertz. I gave the hotel our license plate to enter it in the system to avoid a ticket. When we left florence we rented another car and drove to sorrento.
