But that\u2019s not the way the star system works there.\n\nThere are government mandated criteria that a hotel has to meet at each star rating. They involve things like the size of the reception area, if the hotel provides an elevator, even the number of towels per guest the hotel provides and how often the sheets are changed.\n\nAs the star rating increases the requirements of the lower rating must be met as well as more stringent ones. For example the two star must provide everything the one star does as well as more. And so on up the line.\n\nAll levels must clean guest rooms once per day. But here are some examples of what the star ratings mean at each level.\n\n1 star. The reception area has to be open 12 hours a day. A double room will be at least 14 square meters. Rooms will be cleaned daily and sheets changed once per week. There has to be at least one bathroom for every three rooms.\n\n2 star. Has to have an elevator and change sheets twice a week.\n\n3 star. The reception area has to be open 16 hours per day and the staff must speak at least one foreign language. Staff must wear uniforms.\n\n4 star. Sheets and towels must be replaced daily. Laundry service must be offered. A double room has to be at least 15 square meters. Air conditioning must be provided. All rooms must have an en-suite bathroom.\n\n5 star. Reception area must be open 24 hours. The reception staff must speak three languages and double rooms must be at least 16 square meters.\n\nHow far the reception desk is from the guest rooms is also a factor.\n\nIt\u2019s confusing but those are the kinds of things that Italian hotel star ratings refer to. Not to quality or subjective things like how \u201cnice\u201d the rooms are.\n\nSince many Italian hotels are located in old historic buildings they may have fewer stars just because it might be impossible to retrofit an elevator or AC into the building or en-suite bathrooms into every guest room. The one star doesn\u2019t mean the hotel is not nice and doesn\u2019t indicate lack of quality. And the 4 or 5 star rating doesn\u2019t guarantee quality ( although there may be a correlation.) The way stars are awarded sort of guarantees a nice place full of character in an older building in the city center will have fewer stars than a newer, more generic hotel on the outskirts or in the countryside. So when looking for a hotel it\u2019s usually best to factor in the location, amenities and guest reviews as well as the star rating. Because those stars can often confuse a first time visitor.\n\nSo a 4 star hotel in Italy always means a 4 star by Italian standards, but the visitor will likely be thinking the star is a guarantee of a certain level of quality. It is not, because that\u2019s not what the Italian star system is rating."}, {"username": "Lisa Ball Johnson", "comment_text": "Kelsey Johnson.

Thank you all for the advice and tips, they helped tremendously. Just wanted to share our experience if it may help anyone.\n\nI booked everything for us via Travelocity travel package months out. Hotel, airplane tickets, and tours. I know that\u2019s scary for a lot of folks, but that\u2019s what we did.\n\nFLIGHTS:\nWe flew economy and it was fine. Amazingly there was only a 45 minute delay going and we actually got back about 30 minutes early. I\u2019m a bit on the taller side so I was cramped on the short flight from our hometown to ATL. But the long flights (ATL to FCO going and CDG to ATL coming back) weren\u2019t too bad.\n\nHOTEL:\nWe stayed in Regola Suites which is very near Trastevere (just across the bridge). It was nice. Breakfast was served in the room each morning. The bed was hard, but other than that it was pleasant and quiet. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and it was in a convenient spot. We probably could have walked most places within 25 minutes, but the wife wasn\u2019t too keen on walking, especially in the heat, so we took a lot of taxis.\n\nGETTING AROUND:\nThe hotel booked a private driver for us from Fiumicino airport (55 euros) and back to Fiumicino when we left (75 euros since we had to leave at 3:15am for an early flight). We mostly used Free Now to book taxis to get around the city. We also hailed a couple of taxis right off the street. There was a noticeable difference in price between using the app and just flagging a taxi down. Getting a taxi through the app was 10-12 euros more on average I\u2019d say. And the app was sort of hit or miss. Sometimes it took a long time for a driver to accept, and a couple times none would. So my advice would be to flag a taxi down if you can. Had no issues paying them via CC.\n\nTrain tickets to Florence were booked through Italo 2 months in advance. Had no problems at the station.\n\nPAYING FOR STUFF:\nWe used a CC for just about everything. I had loaded money on our Wise card before we left and we used that to withdraw cash if we needed. ATMs are all over the place and they were easy to use. Only paid fee of 3,75 euros when we withdrew funds, which we only did twice.\n\nTOURS:\nWe did tours in Rome, Florence, Pompeii and The Vatican. A total of 5. All (except the Pantheon) was booked through Travelocity and 3 were handled by City Wonders and one by Florence Specialists. We had zero issues. (Others around us were having issues with Pantheon entry and it seemed very unorganized, but we escaped any problems). Everything went as planned, no last minute changes, cancellations, or hiccups.\n\nMISC:\nYes it was hot, but it took nothing away from our experience.\n\nHad no safety concerns. I was out walking alone in the colosseum area after midnight with no fear. (Take that for what it\u2019s worth).\n\nNo encounters with pickpockets.\n\nCarried a copy of my passport. My wife carried hers in her. No one ever asked to see either.\n\nThe locals were friendly enough, but I found a some to be less than friendly. (Maybe irritated by my bad Italian, but hey, I was giving it my best and attempting to speak the local language).\n\nOnly made reservations to a rooftop restaurant (Ambrosia) for our anniversary dinner and it was great. Everywhere else we had no issues showing up and being seated relatively quickly.\n\nOverall, it was an absolutely amazing experience and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. So go, have fun, and do it your way.\n\nCiao!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2203862766679468/", "likes": 35, "comments": [{"username": "Faten Gharaibeh", "comment_text": "Thanks for sharing"}]}, {"id": "2203977553334656", "text": "Cinque Terre, Lake Como or Lake Garda???
