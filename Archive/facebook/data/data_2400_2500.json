We will be leaving our 4 night stay in Florence and going to Menaggio on Lake Como for our last 3 nights, then flying home out of Milan, 4 pm flight so plenty of time to get there from Menaggio that day.\n\nIn piecing together the routes, it looks like I have a few options -\n\n1. Train Florence to Milan, Milan to Varenna, then Ferry to Menaggio\n\n2. Train Florence to Milan, Milan to Como, then Ferry or Bus to Menaggio\n\n3. Pick up rental car at Florence airport, drive there (free parking at our hotel) and use it to get us to MXP when flying out our last day.\n\nI know the trains are typically the way to go, and if we were staying in Varenna, I would have done this no doubt. But after pieceing all of the legs together, due to train and ferry or bus times, the first two options will take us about 7 hours, and that\u2019s if everything leaves on time. I\u2019ve heard trains can be delayed often and if so that would put us back another hour or two.\n\nI like the idea of just getting in a car (I\u2019ve read picking up at the airport is the way to go) and having it as an option to get us to MXP on our way back. Maybe stopping in Bologna for lunch on the way or somewhere else? The drive time looks like about 4 hours versus 7+ with public transport.\n\nI\u2019ve driven in Portugal with no issues. This would be the only portion of our trip with a car. Looking for some reassurance it would be fairly \u201ceasy\u201d?

For many small towns the train station is down the hill and out of the center of town. I'll recommend one day-long trip I took - \"Cooking with Luca and Lorenzo\". They meet you at the train station in Florence for a short 20 minute ride to a small town and their villa up on the hillside. We made two kinds of pasta, two sauces, and tiramisu.
