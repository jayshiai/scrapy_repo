[{"id": "2207147923017619", "text": "We are at the tail end of our tour of Italy. Many criticized our itinerary, however so far it worked for our family like a charm! We didn\u2019t have an extra day anywhere, nor did we need additional time. I was in Italy many times before, but this was the first time we came on a family trip with a 17 and 20 year old. We needed to make an itinerary which would be a perfect introduction to Italy, so when they travel on their own in the future they can explore further. I knew if I tried to \u201cjam in\u201d too much that everyone would be overwhelmed and they would not remember anything. We planned a versatile trip that suited everyone!\n1. We landed in Rome and we had 2 nights and 2 full days in Rome. It was soooo much fun! We had the colosseum tickets purchased ahead of time and that was the only thing we prebooked. We went to St Peter\u2019s Basilica and we were at the square when the Pope showed up in the window \ud83d\ude2e (didn\u2019t book a tour) and it was a unique experience. We went to the fountain, the steps, Navona, Pantheon (I saw the inside in the past and I really couldn\u2019t wait in line for an hour to get in this time around), and of course, we had dinner twice in Travestere- it was enchanting. We didn\u2019t book any restaurants, just went there and stumbled on many charming trattorias. We also used the shared scooters A LOT! That was FANTASTIC for the entire family. Highly recommend!!! We are in Milan right now and are just about to hop on scooters to zoom around Milan.\n2. Next stop Florence- we rented a car in Rome on our way out of the city and took the side roads through Tuscany towards Florence. We stopped along the way to a random vinery for tasting and bought some wine, as well have lunch at a authentic local restaurant we found somewhere in Chianti. We came to Florence late afternoon. All hotels we booked for this trip were \u201cin the middle of happening\u201d. It was important for us to have a liberty of walking in and out together or separate from the kids, we all needed our freedom. That is why the central location of accommodation was key. Ps, while in Rome we bought 2 SIM cards with prepaid data that we used to keep connected, as wifi \u201cis not really a thing across Italy\u201d. We brought 2 spare phones and bought 2 cards with 20gb each so we always had internet and it was way cheaper that using our roaming plans on our phones. Back to Florence- the only thing we have pre-booked was tickets for Galleria dell Academia. We skipped Uffizi this time. We also had a reservation for Za Za and we were not impressed. The food was ok but it seemed like a tourist attraction. It is way too big and there is a line up even with a reservation. So many smaller better places to eat Florentine steak.\n3. Last minute we spent a night in San Gimignano. BEST DECISSION EVER! Instead of driving there walking for hours and then driving back, you get to explore this beautiful hilltop town at your own pace. That way we experienced fully San Gimignano and it was up to the kids if they wanted to see some of the other towns.\n4. We had a 3 day break at a seaside and we chose Viareggio. It was fantastic! It was a break from the crowds, but also a break from all the tourists lol. I don\u2019t think we saw anyone who was not Italian in Viareggio. We did a stop at Pisa and Luca on our way from San Gimignano. But those couple of beach days were a necessary break for us.\n5. Next stop was Milan. The original plan was to stop at one of the cinque terre towns or Portofino, however since it was raining along the coast we decided to go via Bologna and Modena and stop at the Ducati and Ferrari museums. The kids loved that \ud83d\ude01. Today we are exploring Milan and tomorrow we are heading toward Vicenza.\n6. On our way to Vicenza we will stop in Sirmione for lunch and a quick stop in Verona to see the Juliette\u2019s house. Sleep in stunning Vicenza.\n7. Last stay is in Venice. On the way to Venice we will stop in Padova. And then drop off the car at the Marco Polo airport from where we will take a water taxi to Venice (not the Alilaguna, which made us soooooo sick last year). We have 1 night in Venice but since our flight is late in the evening, I reserved a room in the hotel\nFor one more day so we have somewhere to shower and rest before our flight. That is it! I hope it can help someone with similar interests and pace like our family. \u2764\ufe0f", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2207147923017619/", "likes": 143, "comments": [{"username": "Tracy Wrinn Mcdermott", "comment_text": "Sounds perfect!"}, {"username": "Jennifer Amen", "comment_text": "Sounds like it\u2019s been an amazing trip!

Four days in a relatively small island of Malta will work for you. The last time we were there, we stayed in the peaceful three island area off Valletta and traveled by ferry and bus. Trying to tour Italy in five days is simply too much. We are aggressive travelers might consider, for a first time visit, Rome for 3 days and Venice for two if you want two different experiences. Or, for something different, take the ferry to Sicily and go to Ortigia and Taormina. Italy has so many wonderful spots: Amalfi coast, Puglia, Umbria, Tuscany, the northern lakes, the Dolomites and Italian Alps, the Italian Riviera, Cinque Terre, Sicily, Sardinia and many, many more.

Our hotel is the Hotel Carlton on the Grand Canal, in Santa Croce. I have three questions please:\n1) Does anyone know this hotel and/or area?\u0906\u0923\u0916\u0940 I.e, Are they nice? Safe? Good Resturants?\n2) What\u2019s the best way to travel back to our hotel from the San Marco area at night (9 or 10pm)?\n3) How best to travel to the Venice airport (VCE) from our hotel the morning we depart?\nWe would very much appreciate your experience.
