I think this is contrasted to our visit to Positano a couple days before where we would never dream of bringing a stroller. Way too many stairs, Rome is much more flat and there are alternative routes to avoid some stairs. My suggestion would be to invest in the cheap $100 travel stroller that\u2019s floating around on Tiktok. It folds up fairly slim so you can store it away on the train, bus, wherever. I think that\u2019s our game plan for the next trip. We currently live in Pisa where the sidewalks are similar. We\u2019ve never used a jogging stroller and have been fine thus far.

Our stroller worked wonderfully. I had a carrier too but we were there all month of July so it was way too hot for me to carry. We also had a rental car.
