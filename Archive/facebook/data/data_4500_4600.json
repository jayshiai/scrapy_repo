I didn't visit Cornigila as I've heard there's hundreds of steps to climb from the train station, and after doing the Vernazza to Monterosso hike yesterday my legs were too tired for that today. I'm glad I chose Vernazza to stay at, it's really close to the train station (Riomaggoire and Manarola had long tunnel walkways to wheel your luggage through - they also seemed a bit quiter/not as much atmosphere maybe?). I can't comment on staying at La Spezia, as i always wanted to experience one of the towns, in the evening once the crowds are gone. Well worth it!

We were only in the area for two nights. We would jump on the train and explore Monterosso, Vernazza, and Manarola. What I liked about it was I could run to the large grocery store and cook meals at the AIRBNB. We would venture out in the am, come home and relax, have dinner, and then head back to the 5 Villages. I am not sure about the other villages, but I didn't see any large markets where you could obtain food and cook at home. We were on a budget so this worked out for us and I enjoyed heading back in the evenings when the crowds died down. With that said, we are heading back next summer and I splurged and got a place in Monterosso in Old Town (we really want to hike this time since our kids).

If you\u2019re going from Como to Varenna, and are on a midday ferry, you have a slim chance of getting return tickets. That is because the people that got off in Bellagio are buying them before you ever get to Varenna. If you\u2019re on an early ferry, you\u2019ll likely get tickets.

It was so crowded that I let it go and decided to stay and explore Menaggio. Great decision! I think every town is stunningly beautiful and it's great to pick one and enjoy it thoroughly if you don't have much time. I can ride a boat on a lake anywhere, but exploring the back alleys at a leisurely pace, strolling through the piazzas or along the shore with gelato, these are the things to do in the precious short time spent at Lake Como. I guess if you can afford a private boat tour that would be the way to go, but even then I think you wouldn't have enough time in each place and would still be better off enjoying one town.

Lemme return your kindness by sharing a few things I realised:\n\n1. Leonardo express is so convenient when you want to get to Termini Station from FCO. You can just buy your ticket there (15 euros only) and after 32 min, you are at the station. Do this when your hotel is near the station. Extremely easy, no need to book in advance.\n\n2. I did use the subway as suggested by rome2rio, it took me a while to find it but it is manageable ( I am a solo traveler and since I traveled with just a carry-on.. I was able to navigate easily. Many have warned us about pickpocketers, just be extra vigilant and you will be fine) I do not mean to discount the stories of those who have lost their essentials and I am sorry for such experiences you had. All I wanna say is, if you choose to take public transportation, be mindful of your surroundings all the time.\n\n3. After the subway was the plot twist, I still had to get an uber to find my way to the hotel. I am staying at TH Roma Carpegnale hotel which is not that far from the station. It took me almost an hour to find one. Uber works fine but it depends on where you are. They are pretty particular with the pick up point so it is not like you will just type where u are and they will find you. On the contrary, they will let u know where and u must find it.\n\n4. Having said those, while I tried to be economical by using the train and subway, then uber- I computed and realised it is a lot better if I just took a taxi from the airport (esp my hotel is not near Termini Station) I could have saved more (time and money)\n\n5. Shoes are always a topic in this group, I agree, wear comfortable ones but once here, you will find so many women wearing heels and sandals and they are just okay. (Again, u know yourself better-no one will judge u if u did not wear your rubber shoes)\n\n6. I used the e-sim Airalo and it works perfectly.\n7. Cards are accepted pretty much everywhere. no need to carry lots of cash (just enough to tip)\n8. I did not have everything planned and ate at wherever looks authentic Italian restaurant whenever I got hungry. Part of the joy for me.\n9. weather is hot but not unbearable \ud83d\ude42\n10. Let me conclude by saying, do not be afraid to \u201cRome\u201d around- you may be lost but it is all worth it.

So my husband ( with wallet in pocket) was being jolted by 2 ladies whilst my son and I struggled to get on- on a quiet carriage but they were half blocking the doors. By the time I got on, I could see the distraction technique, told my husband to move away. In a split second they had taken his wallet. Luckily doors were closed, he grabbed the thief\u2019s shoulder shouting where\u2019s the wallet, I grabbed the bag of her accomplice who pointed at the floor- she had just dropped it so we got it back. You are right, they are very clever and it was because of this FB group, I recognised the diversion. Techniques people had spoken about.

Thought I would share! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFlorence & Rome Recommendations\nGeneral Rules of Thumb:\n\u2022 Gelato places that have huge mounds of gelato with fake fruit piled on top are going to be low quality, tourist traps! \u2013 search for silver tins/even some with lids, for more authentic gelato\n\u2022 Restaurants with pictures of the food outside/on the menu are tourist traps \u2013 normally located around the big attractions, try to avoid if you can additionally, seek Osterias and Trattorias \u2013 ristorantes are usually not the best\n\u2022 When eating outside, try to not leave your phone/wallet out on the table or sling your bag over the back of your chair \u2013 pickpockets are very savvy and will not be deterred that you\u2019re sitting at a restaurant when it comes to getting their targets.\n\u2022 Water is not free when you go out to eat, unlike here at home. Not an ungodly cost, but just factor that in whilst ordering! Specify still/flat water!\n\u2022 Breakfast is not really a thing, maybe a pastry and espresso but do not expect omelets and pancakes at the hotel. Lunch is traditionally a smaller meal, check restaurant hours because lots will open for a small lunch window and close again before dinner. Dinner is late \u2013 8/8:30ish.\n\u2022 Florence - The grocery store is CONAD, there is one right next to the Duomo with a huge wine selection, meats and cheeses, snacks, etc. since you will be eating later \u2013 perhaps a glass of wine and a snack on the steps of some beautiful building will hold you over until dinner, open container law can be a wonderful thing\n\nFlorence\n\u2022 Osteria Santo Spirito \u2013 truffle gnocchi and bruschetta is to die for, try to eat outside if you can, make a reservation!\n\u2022 Simbiosi \u2013 pizza is not as common or as delicious as you are envisioning in Florence\u2013 however Simbiosi has the most delicious pizza of all. Beautiful restaurant, great wine menu, and fairly inexpensive.\n\u2022 Panini Toscani \u2013 the only Piazza del Duomo recommendation \u2013 free samples, delicious, can still taste my order and miss it daily\n\u2022 All\u2019Antico Vinaio \u2013 paninis didn\u2019t hit the spot for me the same way it hit the spot for everyone else\u2026 have amassed international fame though so they\u2019re clearly doing something correctly\n\u2022 Trattoria 13 Gobi \u2013 internationally recognized for their rigatoni dish, as they should be \u2013 also recommend the penne with steak and red wine sauce\n\u2022 Acqua al Due \u2013 I have dreams about their blueberry steak, they have a steak sampler, pasta sampler, and a salad sampler \u2013 try it all!\n\u2022 Quattro Leoni \u2013 pear and pecorino ravioli and cheesecake\u2026 \u2764\n\u2022 Il Mercato Centrale \u2013 Heaven on Earth. Basically, a food court with a bar in the middle \u2013 everyone can get what they want and try each other\u2019s \u2013 from caprese salads to sushi, they also host cooking classes which could be a lot of fun!\n\u2022 Trattoria Za Za \u2013 They have the entire breadth of Italian wants and menu needs \u2013 very well known for their Florentine steak! Make a reservation!\n\u2022 La Giostra \u2013 if you want to have a more expensive, slightly more formal meal whilst you\u2019re there, known for their steak. Ambiance is beautiful \u2013 make a reservation! Pics of famous people who have been there line the walls\u2026 worth it for a reason!\n\u2022 La Buchetta \u2013 angels and demons gnocchi (basically alfredo sauce with a little spice)\n\u2022 Gelateria del Neri \u2013 arguably the best gelato in all of Florence\n\u2022 Don Nino and Edoardo\u2019s \u2013 both in the Piazza del Duomo, loved by many \u2013 a little pricier because you\u2019re paying for location, but still good\n\u2022 La Carraia \u2013 inexpensive, lots of flavors, have two Florence locations\n\u2022 Strega Nocciola \u2013 incredible, no notes for this gelato\n\u2022 View on Art \u2013 never made it here myself, but rooftop bar with the perfect view of the Duomo\n\u2022 Golden View \u2013 rather than a view of the duomo, there is a view of the Ponte Vecchio \u2013 seafood restaurant if you\u2019re also looking for a carb break \ud83d\ude0a\n\u2022 Rosalia\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of Italian food in not a lot of time, if you are craving a smoothie or something green, more delicious and fresher Panera\n\u2022 Gusta Pizza \u2013 Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives traveled here \u2013 delicious, what you would hope Italian pizza to taste like! Check the hours before you go\n\u2022 Il Profeta \u2013 expensive, however, out of this world. Owned by a husband and wife \u2013 the best thing is the chocolate cake\n\u2022 Il Teatro \u2013 20 euros for family style deliciousness \u2013 \u201cunlimited wine\u201d, a giant charcuterie platter that has these fried pasta dough balls that I dream of whenever I take a bite of bread, plus meats and cheese, and bruschetta. Then, three different pasta dishes that are rotating but could be pesto, alfredo, tortellini, etc. finally, there is a dessert platter with panna cotta, flan, cheesecake, and more. More casual if you wanted a more \u201clet loose\u201d evening.\n\nRome\n\u2022 Osteria da Fortunata \u2013 an elderly woman sits in the window and hand makes the pasta\u2026 do you need any other reason to go there\n\u2022 Taverna Trilussa \u2013 did not eat here myself, but heard amazing things \u2013 apparently expensive\n\u2022 Giolitti \u2013 gelato and other delicious treats\n\u2022 Old Bridge Gelateria \u2013 so many flavors of gelato\n\u2022 Da Buffeto \u2013 best pizza in Rome\n\u2022 Dar Poeta \u2013 also pizza, also the best", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2199664997099245/", "likes": 543, "comments": [{"username": "Lillie Botica", "comment_text": "Drina Botica"}, {"username": "Tiara Jane Bantugan", "comment_text": "Gj Bantugan"}, {"username": "Gretchen Barretto", "comment_text": "Joash Isaiah CastilloJoachim Miguel Castillo Mel Castillo please note.
