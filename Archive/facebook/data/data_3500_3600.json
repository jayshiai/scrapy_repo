For reference, we lived across from the Villa Borghese museum, so outside the historic district but still relatively close.\nFor one day, we hired a private guide and booked a car service. My mother in law had a rolling walker. The driver took us to Piazza Venizia. The guide walked with us, at my mother in law\u2019s pace, down the avenue (vehicles are not allowed), past the forum towards the Colosseum. The guide gave us a commentary about everything, and you can see a lot from the road, so that was interesting for my mother in law and her friend. The car and driver met us by the arch near the Colosseum and drove us to the Circus Maximus. Again, more explanation from the guide. Then the driver took us to the Pantheon and was able to get us within 50 yards of the site. We had our visit there and then did the same thing at the Spanish steps. I believe we spent about 6 hours total. It was fairly expensive to do this, but worth it to us. I think the same thing could be done with a good tour guide and taxis. It really helped that the guide was communicating with the driver about the exact places to drop us off and pick us up. I know some Italian but even having lived in Rome for a couple of years at that point, I didn\u2019t know enough about the city to be able to precisely indicate where I wanted to go. And the commentary was wonderful because we weren\u2019t rushed and could just listen.\nOn another day, I booked a private tour of the Vatican. I let them know about my MILs capabilities and they took us in early, borrowed a wheelchair from the museum and the guide pushed the wheelchair through the museum. There are elevators that the guides can use for disabled guests. The only problem was that you can\u2019t get from the Sistine Chapel to St. Peter\u2019s without using stairs so we had to exit the way we entered.\nAnother day, we took a taxi to Piazza Navona. The driver was wonderful. I just asked to get us as close as possible to the Piazza. I expected to be taken to the nearest taxi stand (which I was familiar with), but she went down tiny side streets and dropped us at the base of the square just steps from one of the fountains.\nAnother day, we took a taxi to the Colosseum with the idea of just getting a few photos and perhaps doing a short walk around the area (more for my MULs friend) and while we we taking photos, someone from the Colosseum staff came and took us to a special entrance for the disabled, so we paid the regular fee and went into the Colosseum - no line! There is an elevator inside, so although wheelchairs can\u2019t go everywhere, you can get some great views and have a good experience.\nThere are blogs about accessibility in Italy, and I found one before their visit that really helped to identify hotels and restaurants that were appropriate.\nSorry for the long post but I thought my experience might help you. There are things you can do with someone in a wheelchair in Rome, but driving yourself is not practical because of parking problems and traffic and frankly, you will be able to get much closer if dropped off by a taxi.\nNote that you need to tease arch restaurants in advance. If, for no other reason than restrooms in restaurants are often either upstairs or downstairs (and the stairs can be steep). The blogs I mentioned have identified many restaurants that are accessible.\nWe also did a weekend trip to Florence and had good luck with that. Taxi drivers were very helpful and Florence is flatter than Rome so my MIL was able to use her walker to go to restaurants and explore a bit.\nBest of luck.

We used private tours in both the Vatican and the Coliseum as it was really helpful to go at our own pace.\nWe also did a 2 hour walking tour that was awesome! Super nice to be able to stay in my chair and not have to get in and out of a vehicle at every stop. People talk about how the cobblestones are impossible with a wheelchair, however, I've never had too much trouble with them, either wheeling myself, or my husband wheeling me. You have to make some adjustments of course, and you might need to go a bit slower in spots, but it's perfectly doable and not as big of a deal as some may suggest.

We secured tax refund on our purchase at the Rome FCO airport.\n\nSharing some info that might be useful for members of this group.\n\nWhat is the percentage of tax you can claim?\n\nIt depends on the item you have purchased and what arrangement the retailer has with the the 'tax refund company' such as Global Blue etc. We had items for which the refund was 15% while for a high value item we got 18%.\n\nWhen to claim refund?\n\nOption 1: After security the check:\n\nComplete the check in, have the boarding pass, clear security and passport control. You must have the items and invoice with you. Go to customs counter near the security gates and show the items and get the invoice stamped. Then go to the refund company counter to get the refund.\n\nWe did not do this option as we felt there are couple of problems with this option:\n\n- Once you clear the security you will only have say an hour or so for your flight. Based your flight time of the day, there will be a LONG queue in front of the customs and refund company counters. In the worst scenario you may have to give up on your refund as you don't want to miss the flight!\n\n- refund will be to your credit card only (no cash). The actual refund transaction takes place after several weeks (this is what we were told). Should there be a dispute or discrepancy you are helpless to resolve as you won't be in Italy. Risky.\n\nWe were carrying items costing in five digits and refund was in four digits. We didn't want to take risk so we took the below option:\n\nOption 2: Before the security check:\n\n- Arrive at the airport few hours early.\nHave your boarding pass (we did online check in the previous day and had our boarding passes in our email.) So don't go to your airline counter to check in the bags.\n\n- Head straight to the refund company counter first. They are in all terminals and ours was in T3 (see pics below). Show the invoice and the boarding pass.\nFor any not-so-high value item they won't (for us they did not) insist on customs stamp to make refund. You have a choice of refund by cash or refund to your card. They charge a very small fee for cash refund.\n\n- For the high value item we had, we went to the customs counter and showed the item and the boarding pass, got the invoice stamped and then went to the refund counter. Promptly got the cash refund. We kept our items in the check-in luggage. We then went to our airline counter and dropped out bags.\n\nIt took us about half an hour for the whole process.\n\nThis option gave us the peace of mind and was less stressful. We were glad we completed all this before security as there was very long queue for refund after security (option 1).\n\nIn the free time we had before boarding we enjoyed some more Italian food and of course some great wine!\n\nHope this info is useful. Please note this was our experience and might be different to others.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2202809990118079/", "likes": 142, "comments": [{"username": "Marinor Gilanga Protacio", "comment_text": "Thank you!

Despite warnings about how hot it has been, the weather has been very nice. Yes it gets hot midday. But overall it\u2019s been fine.\n\nWe booked a David tour, a tour through the Uffizi gallery. The only things we didn\u2019t book was the Duomo and i recommend you do that as well. We booked a self guided Vespa tour through Tuscany. But we ended up not doing this because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving a motorcycle through the busy streets of Florence with my teenager on back. So if you do this, I recommend having some experience beforehand! We did a pasta-making class and this was a highlight! Highly recommend.\n\nOn to my favorite part, FOOD!!! Thanks to your recommendations, we ate so much good food. We are at Trattoria 13 Gobbi 2x. Get the rigatoni!!! You need reservations. You have to try the gnocchi at Osteria Santo Spirito. Best of my life! No reservations required for lunch. We ate at il Santo Bevitore for lunch one day. Also incredible. Al antico for sandwiches is definitely an experience. Line out the door but moves quickly. We had Florentine steak at Cambi and it was delicious. We never made it to Bucco Mario which comes highly recommended as well as La Giostra. La Giostra was booked weeks out. If you want to go there, book far in advance. Here are some pics of our food and adventures! Hope this helps your adventure!

There are beaches of varying degrees of wonderful up and down both sides of The Boot, and the vast majority of Italians grow up with the understanding that part of every summer involves time spent at the shore.\n\nIt sounds idyllic, no?\n\nTraveling to Italy in summer is the perfect time to get in on this Italian beach culture, not least because it can be agonizingly hot and humid in the cities. Spontaneity when planning a summer trip to an Italian beach isn\u2019t usually a good thing, however. Those who plan ahead in this department are the ones who reap the rewards.\nWhich is why you\u2019re here, you clever planner, you.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what you need to know about the beaches in Italy, before you don your suit and head for the sand.\n\n\"Private\" beaches in Italy\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of my life in Oregon, where all beaches are public by law. For me, then, this is one of the aspects of Italian beach culture that surprised me most.\n\nWhile, technically, the beaches themselves are \u201cpublic\u201d (and the strip of land right at the water\u2019s edge is certainly that), there are concessions (called \u201cstabilimenti\u201d or \u201cbagni\u201d) at nearly every stretch of sand that have bought permits from local authorities to set up rows and rows of beach chairs (\u201clettini,\u201d or beds) and umbrellas (\u201combrelle\u201d) that they then rent out. Again, technically, while anyone should be able to walk to the water from further up on the beach, the bagni are usually set up so close together \u2013 one group of colored umbrellas abutting the next \u2013 that passing between them is impossible. And walking through one of them without paying isn\u2019t permitted by the folks running that particular concession.\n\nYou may hear about protestors fighting this, demanding more access to beaches, but it doesn\u2019t seem to change the status quo.\n\nSo, if you choose to pay for the privilege of hanging out on an Italian beach, what do you get for your money? Quite a bit, actually. Not only do you have a comfy lounge chair and shade-providing umbrella set up for you (without the need to lug one around yourself), you are also granted access to the facilities at the stabilimento \u2013 usually including changing rooms, showers, toilets, places to store your clothes, and places to get food and beverages. There are also typically lifeguards on duty.\n\nYou can choose just a chair, or a chair with an umbrella, for different fees \u2013 and if you\u2019ll be in town for awhile, you can also buy a pass good for a longer period of time. Many Italians have annual rentals at the same bagni, where they get a monthly pass \u2013 and therefore the best spots. And yes, when you pay for access to the private beach you\u2019ll be directed toward a chair \u2013 you don\u2019t get to choose.\n\n\"Public\" Beaches in Italy\n\nThe rest of the beaches in Italy are entirely public, and therefore free. These are, perhaps unsurprisingly, not always as nice, clean, or well-maintained as the \u201cprivate\u201d beaches. You can look for signs indicating which beaches or parts of the beach are free (look for the words \u201cspiaggia libera\u201d), but it\u2019s a good bet that the areas without orderly rows of umbrellas and loungers are public beaches.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge variance among public beaches in terms of what amenities are available. Some of them have public toilets and showers. There are often beachside restaurants or kiosks nearby, even if they\u2019re just temporary affairs set up for the summer months. Sometimes, however, there is simply a stretch of sand (or pebbles) and that\u2019s it. In many cases, access to the public beach is via a long staircase from a parking area up above, so be prepared for something of a hike. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the area, it\u2019s a good idea to inquire about the facilities before you head out, lest you arrive for a day at the beach without necessary provisions.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to keep a close eye on your belongings, especially on busy public beaches. These are not monitored by anyone, so would-be pickpockets and petty thieves sometimes meander through looking for easy targets. Make sure it\u2019s not you.\n\nItalian Beach Attire\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re familiar with the often-comically-portrayed stereotype of old Italian men at the beach in Speedos, letting a lifetime\u2019s worth of pasta gut all hang out. Stereotypes usually have at least some basis in fact, and \u2013 yes \u2013 those guys exist. In fact, the Speedo-type suit is still de rigeur for many older Italian (and European) men. More common these days, however, especially for younger men, are swim trunks.\n\nFor women of all ages, a bikini or two-piece is the way to go. One-piece suits are something of a rarity on Italian beaches, no matter one\u2019s age or body type. (Italian women think \u201cbikini body\u201d means \u201cany body on which you put a bikini,\u201d which is a million kinds of wonderful, if you ask me.)\n\nIn some parts of Italy, topless sunbathing is common and not restricted to certain beaches or areas \u2013 bare breasts not being seen as the taboo that they seem to be in the United States. Nude sunbathing, however, is usually restricted to certain areas that may or may not be specially-designated as nude beaches (they may be unofficially categorized as such, in that locals all know where the invisible boundary is). If you\u2019re looking for (or trying to avoid) a nude beach, ask around. And before you take off your top on any beach, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure you\u2019re not the only one doing so \u2013 just in case you\u2019re in a part of the country where that\u2019s not such an accepted norm. As in many other situations, best practice is to follow the lead of the locals.\n\nItaly is nothing if not fashionable, and that extends to beach vacations. Even in beach towns, you won\u2019t see people walking into restaurants or shops wearing flip-flops or bikini tops. Beach attire is for the beach, and that\u2019s that. Men, top off your stylish (and dry) swim trunks with an equally-stylish tee shirt. Women, put on a pretty sundress or beach cover-up dress over your swimsuit. And everyone, swap the plastic beach sandals for something a bit nicer.\n\nAugust on an Italian Beach\n\nMany Italians and other Europeans get about a month of vacation time each summer, often in August. And if you\u2019ve ever seen an Italian beach in August, you might think every single last one of them spends that vacation on a beach in Italy.\n\nYeah, beaches in Italy in August are crowded.\nRemember earlier when I said that as fun as a spontaneous day trip to that pretty Italian beach in August sounds, it isn\u2019t necessarily a good idea? This is why. Because so many people spend a few weeks at the seaside every single summer, you bet they\u2019ve booked well in advance \u2013 everything from their hotel or apartment to their beach chairs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that you shouldn\u2019t go to the beach in the summer if you\u2019re in Italy \u2013 far from it. It just means that you\u2019ll be far happier doing so if you can plan ahead a bit. Book lodging in advance, and \u2013 if you can \u2013 arrange for spots at a stabilimento. Make your time at the beach as relaxing as it ought to be with a little advance legwork.\n\nBlue Flag Beaches\n\nThe Blue Flag program is a global environmental effort that gives out its Blue Flag awards to beaches and marinas that meet its list of more than 30 criteria (including water quality, services available, and overall safety).

Because it was spring break/Easter things were also quite crowded. We still had an amazing time, including my 15 year old son and 5 year old daughter.\n\nWe flew into to Milan and out of Rome. A thing I didn't realize until almost too late was how early things book up in advance. I was still able to get tickets to everything we wanted, but sometimes had to choose tours over just buying tickets and also had some tickets too close together to not feel rushed (only 2 hours in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence , for instance). Still amazing and worth all the stress.\n\nSorrento was great! It's relaxing and laid back, with not so many stairs to climb as some of the Amalfi coast towns. Pompeii was a bucket list item for both me and my husband and the kids were both interested as well. Ercalano/\nHerculaneum is maybe even cooler, though and they are both on the same train line. We saw them both on the same day - it was a lot of walking - and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Da Fillipos was fantastic for Easter lunch. https://\nwww.facebook.com\n/dafilippo1983/ And our host's son owns https://\nwww.facebook.com\n/\nradicalsorrento which was great for brunch (kids got pancakes and bacon which they had missed a little bit).\n\nWe stayed in Bologna at firs to visit it and because it's a quick train ride to both Venice and Florence which we did as day trips. We drove down the Adriatic coast to Atri because my husband's family is from a nearby mountain village. I knew nothing about Abruzzo before planning the trip, but it was spectacularly beautiful and has some great hiking. You drive right through the Appinine mountains to get to Sorrento or Rome and that was pretty cool.\n\nIf you're driving a long way, I have to say that lunch at Autogrill on the Autostrada was not at all a hardship. I didn't expect to enjoy eating my first meal in Italy (at least in the last 30 years) at a rest stop, but immigration took forever, we needed to get to our Airbnb to check in, and decided to give it a try. Made fresh in front of you, tasty, and fast. It's only low quality compared to all the other amazing places you'll eat in Italy, but still better than many high end Italian restaurants in the US.\n\nWe spent our last few days in Rome.

Two weeks in Italy not enough!"}, {"username": "Deborah Schroeder", "comment_text": "First thing is, stay with the itinerary you have chosen because that is what you want to see. Having people say take a day here or a night here or add this or subtract that, that is well and fine but based on their experiences. Second, work with your teenagers on what they to see-family affair. Each person has the 1 thing that is the most important thing to see. Third, do your research. I recommend Romewise and Florencewise -on FB and YouTube, Rick Steves book on Italy. For Rome, plot on a map the most important places you want to visit and get a hotel that is most central. The Monti area or the Pantheon area is good. You will be doing a lot of walking and you need to plan efficiently to make the most of your visit. Fourth, plot in the travel time from each location and then see how much time is really left. Example is Pienza, which is wonderful and I am sure you will love it but, a lot of travel for 1 day. Figure out what is so important in Amalfi that you need to do and see if they are open/\navailable. Many people will say, and I agree, eliminate the far south or the far north and maximize what is left if you are on a tight travel time. As for flights, cheaper to arrive and leave from the same airport but open-jaw flights give you less travel and more enjoyment. Purchase your tickets from the airline direct and look to not change planes in Europe but fly direct from your country if possible. Yes, the price goes up a bit, but the convenience is worth it. You mentioned Venice, it really is amazing and something teenagers will love. Easy to open-jaw. March weather will be unpredictable, but you take that chance. Last, don't look at Italy as this is a one- time trip and I have to see it all but look at Italy as the most amazing experience you all will have, and you will come back again.

There are beaches of varying degrees of wonderful up and down both sides of The Boot, and the vast majority of Italians grow up with the understanding that part of every summer involves time spent at the shore.\n\nIt sounds idyllic, no?\n\nTraveling to Italy in summer is the perfect time to get in on this Italian beach culture, not least because it can be agonizingly hot and humid in the cities. Spontaneity when planning a summer trip to an Italian beach isn\u2019t usually a good thing, however. Those who plan ahead in this department are the ones who reap the rewards.\nWhich is why you\u2019re here, you clever planner, you.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what you need to know about the beaches in Italy, before you don your suit and head for the sand.\n\n\"Private\" beaches in Italy\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of my life in Oregon, where all beaches are public by law. For me, then, this is one of the aspects of Italian beach culture that surprised me most.\n\nWhile, technically, the beaches themselves are \u201cpublic\u201d (and the strip of land right at the water\u2019s edge is certainly that), there are concessions (called \u201cstabilimenti\u201d or \u201cbagni\u201d) at nearly every stretch of sand that have bought permits from local authorities to set up rows and rows of beach chairs (\u201clettini,\u201d or beds) and umbrellas (\u201combrelle\u201d) that they then rent out. Again, technically, while anyone should be able to walk to the water from further up on the beach, the bagni are usually set up so close together \u2013 one group of colored umbrellas abutting the next \u2013 that passing between them is impossible. And walking through one of them without paying isn\u2019t permitted by the folks running that particular concession.\n\nYou may hear about protestors fighting this, demanding more access to beaches, but it doesn\u2019t seem to change the status quo.\n\nSo, if you choose to pay for the privilege of hanging out on an Italian beach, what do you get for your money? Quite a bit, actually. Not only do you have a comfy lounge chair and shade-providing umbrella set up for you (without the need to lug one around yourself), you are also granted access to the facilities at the stabilimento \u2013 usually including changing rooms, showers, toilets, places to store your clothes, and places to get food and beverages. There are also typically lifeguards on duty.\n\nYou can choose just a chair, or a chair with an umbrella, for different fees \u2013 and if you\u2019ll be in town for awhile, you can also buy a pass good for a longer period of time. Many Italians have annual rentals at the same bagni, where they get a monthly pass \u2013 and therefore the best spots. And yes, when you pay for access to the private beach you\u2019ll be directed toward a chair \u2013 you don\u2019t get to choose.\n\n\"Public\" Beaches in Italy\n\nThe rest of the beaches in Italy are entirely public, and therefore free. These are, perhaps unsurprisingly, not always as nice, clean, or well-maintained as the \u201cprivate\u201d beaches. You can look for signs indicating which beaches or parts of the beach are free (look for the words \u201cspiaggia libera\u201d), but it\u2019s a good bet that the areas without orderly rows of umbrellas and loungers are public beaches.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge variance among public beaches in terms of what amenities are available. Some of them have public toilets and showers. There are often beachside restaurants or kiosks nearby, even if they\u2019re just temporary affairs set up for the summer months. Sometimes, however, there is simply a stretch of sand (or pebbles) and that\u2019s it. In many cases, access to the public beach is via a long staircase from a parking area up above, so be prepared for something of a hike. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the area, it\u2019s a good idea to inquire about the facilities before you head out, lest you arrive for a day at the beach without necessary provisions.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to keep a close eye on your belongings, especially on busy public beaches. These are not monitored by anyone, so would-be pickpockets and petty thieves sometimes meander through looking for easy targets. Make sure it\u2019s not you.\n\nItalian Beach Attire\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re familiar with the often-comically-portrayed stereotype of old Italian men at the beach in Speedos, letting a lifetime\u2019s worth of pasta gut all hang out. Stereotypes usually have at least some basis in fact, and \u2013 yes \u2013 those guys exist. In fact, the Speedo-type suit is still de rigeur for many older Italian (and European) men. More common these days, however, especially for younger men, are swim trunks.\n\nFor women of all ages, a bikini or two-piece is the way to go. One-piece suits are something of a rarity on Italian beaches, no matter one\u2019s age or body type. (Italian women think \u201cbikini body\u201d means \u201cany body on which you put a bikini,\u201d which is a million kinds of wonderful, if you ask me.)\n\nIn some parts of Italy, topless sunbathing is common and not restricted to certain beaches or areas \u2013 bare breasts not being seen as the taboo that they seem to be in the United States. Nude sunbathing, however, is usually restricted to certain areas that may or may not be specially-designated as nude beaches (they may be unofficially categorized as such, in that locals all know where the invisible boundary is). If you\u2019re looking for (or trying to avoid) a nude beach, ask around. And before you take off your top on any beach, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure you\u2019re not the only one doing so \u2013 just in case you\u2019re in a part of the country where that\u2019s not such an accepted norm. As in many other situations, best practice is to follow the lead of the locals.\n\nItaly is nothing if not fashionable, and that extends to beach vacations. Even in beach towns, you won\u2019t see people walking into restaurants or shops wearing flip-flops or bikini tops. Beach attire is for the beach, and that\u2019s that. Men, top off your stylish (and dry) swim trunks with an equally-stylish tee shirt. Women, put on a pretty sundress or beach cover-up dress over your swimsuit. And everyone, swap the plastic beach sandals for something a bit nicer.\n\nAugust on an Italian Beach\n\nMany Italians and other Europeans get about a month of vacation time each summer, often in August. And if you\u2019ve ever seen an Italian beach in August, you might think every single last one of them spends that vacation on a beach in Italy.\n\nYeah, beaches in Italy in August are crowded.\nRemember earlier when I said that as fun as a spontaneous day trip to that pretty Italian beach in August sounds, it isn\u2019t necessarily a good idea? This is why. Because so many people spend a few weeks at the seaside every single summer, you bet they\u2019ve booked well in advance \u2013 everything from their hotel or apartment to their beach chairs.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that you shouldn\u2019t go to the beach in the summer if you\u2019re in Italy \u2013 far from it. It just means that you\u2019ll be far happier doing so if you can plan ahead a bit. Book lodging in advance, and \u2013 if you can \u2013 arrange for spots at a stabilimento. Make your time at the beach as relaxing as it ought to be with a little advance legwork.\n\nBlue Flag Beaches\n\nThe Blue Flag program is a global environmental effort that gives out its Blue Flag awards to beaches and marinas that meet its list of more than 30 criteria (including water quality, services available, and overall safety). There are so-called Blue Flag beaches all over the world, including many in Italy.\n\nThe list of Blue Flag beaches in Italy changes periodically, as the sites are regularly evaluated by the organization, with existing beaches removed and new ones added.\n\nBy KareninCalabria", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2202476656818079/", "likes": 60, "comments": [{"username": "Lucy Lou", "comment_text": "I love this, I will now wear my bikini happily now next summer.\n\nJust back from Spain and also the same situation now in many places with renting sunbeds on the beach\n\nHowever, I am in Scotland and we get about three days of summer so damn right I will never complain about a lounger and shade on the beach."}, {"username": "Lisa Adams Robertson", "comment_text": "Also, many beaches are rocky.
