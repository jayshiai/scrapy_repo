It was insanity at Como when we arrived, huge queue for ferry tickets and fast ferries sold out hours in advance. Looked at the bus option, which was even worse that day \ud83d\ude48 so got a slow ferry a few hours later and enjoyed a leisurely lunch while we waited. Got to Bellagio and were beyond happy. It\u2019s been 16yrs since our last visit! Not much has changed, and we frequented our favourite bar by the water every afternoon. A day trip to Menaggio and Varenna (gorgeous lunch stop). A day trip to FoxTown on the Swiss border - we have previously driven from Switzerland into Italy and we love a shopping stop there, bargains to be had! - so we caught the train up. Took the bus to/from Como that day, the views were superb, and it only takes slightly longer than a fast ferry (for about 1/4 of the price). Our 4nts flew.\nSecond stop Venice, which we haven\u2019t seen for 10yrs. I wasn\u2019t sure how much we would enjoy it, but I can safely say we loved it! Our daughter was four last time we went, so clearly this made a huge difference. We did a gondola for the first time. We had cocktails (a mocktail for the 14yo!) at a rooftop bar, we caught Vaporetto everywhere, found some great cafes, we checked out the views from the DFS roof - link in comments, book 21 days in advance, it\u2019s free and a must-do - and we had a great apartment on the Grand Canal. Loved every second of our three night stay.\nWe collected a car from Europcar and drove down as far as San Benedetto del Tronto for an over nighter to break up the journey to Monopoli. Arrived in magnificent Monopoli the following afternoon and WOW. Just WOW! It was like entering a travel brochure! We had rented an apartment in the old town, which you\u2019re able to drive into btwn 3:30-5:30 for only 15 mins to unload your bags and then get out, as it\u2019s a pedestrian-only area. I cannot recommend this village enough, it blew our minds how gorgeous it was. We needed the chill week by the Adriatic to unwind from all we had already done, and it was perfect. Drove to a few nearby beaches on different days, visited Polignano a Mare, but the highlight of day trips was easily Matera - what an astounding step back in time, just a jaw dropping, mind blowing village. No words can describe. Link in comments. But do yourself a huge favour and visit Monopoli/Puglia, it\u2019s amazing.\nLast stop was Milan. Caught the train from Bari after returning our car. A long trip (8hrs) so it wrote off the day, which I hate, but flights had been crazy expensive prior to our departure. Sadly someone decided to steal my suitcase in Bologna - now found but what a saga to get it home \ud83d\ude48 - which didn\u2019t put us in a good mindset, but we explored Milan nevertheless. Duomo is stunning, esp at night, but the rest of Milan we were quite underwhelmed. I wish we\u2019d perhaps gone to Rome (which we\u2019ve seen maybe four times) for our flight home. Anyway, we won\u2019t die wondering what Milan is like!\nSo a magnificent - if somewhat busy - trip rich in more memories for our little family. If you want any tips or advice on any of our stops just shout out. All I can say is pack your sense of adventure, an open mind, a teaspoon of patience (some days more than one required\ud83d\ude1d), your manners, a few Italian phrases, eat lots of gelato and enjoy every second of your holiday! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd70", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2194809700918108/", "likes": 4077, "comments": [{"username": "Laurie Heederik", "comment_text": "Never did like her and never will now."}, {"username": "Jenny John Walker", "comment_text": "We visited Udine in the North not far from Trieste and Venice, used to belong to the Austrian empire 200 years ago.
