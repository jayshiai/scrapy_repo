It is home to vibrant cities, world-famous landmarks, distinct regions, and natural beauty. Having your own car in Italy gives you the flexibility and freedom to explore outside of Italy\u2019s major cities. You can visit ancient ruins, sample wine at vineyards, stay in agriturismi (working farms), swim in crystal clear water at the beach in Puglia, or road trip through the Dolomite mountains up north. For Cheapest Car Rental Rates have a look here: https://www.discovercars.com/?a_aid=NextStop-Italy\nDRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIREMENTS\nItaly recognises EU drivers licenses.\nDrivers from non-EU countries may use their home country licenses accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or official translation. You must obtain your IDP in your home country.\nYou must have your drivers license (and IDP, if required) with you at all times.\nRental companies require drivers to be between 25 and 65 years of age, but some companies will allow younger or older drivers, often with a supplementary fee. In some cases, you may rent a car at age 19 or 20, but only a specific type of car (small). Most rental companies require drivers to be at least 21 (again, paying a supplement).\nCar rental agencies in Italy require you to have had your driver\u2019s license for at least one year before the rental.\nAlways check the rental contract terms and conditions for specific age and driver\u2019s license requirements.\nFor Cheapest Car Rental Rates have a look here: https://www.discovercars.com/?a_aid=NextStop-Italy", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2177237569341988/", "likes": 15, "comments": [{"username": "Michelle O'Connell", "comment_text": "Steve Mortland we need to renew our IDR"}]}, {"id": "2185834111815667", "text": "Paddle boarding tour from Sorrento to Bagni Regina Giovanna\nThere\u2019s one surefire way to escape the Amalfi Coast\u2019s crowds: get on the water.

So easy!\n\n-Google translate\n\n-WhatsApp- our hotels and B&Bs used this to communicate directly with us.\n\n-Mobile Passport App- we had a super short wait to get back through customs. We even had a 12 year old with us.\n\n-gel pedicures pre- trip\n\n- Bring a washcloth!\n\n-We had no safety concerns- just aware of our surroundings. A Fanny Pack/ crossbody was super helpful. We did carry on only. It was the best/ easiest for us.\n\n-Take the water taxi into Venice.\n\n-Take a food tour of Trastevere.\n\n- 50 Euro will get a family of 4 in a taxi straight to/from your hotel and FCO in Rome.\n\n-Aperol spritz are great any time of day.\n\n-Private external bathrooms can get you a cheaper hotel room- a deal provided no one has to get up at night to pee! \ud83e\udd23\n\n-Check that temp before using the bidet!\n\nI hope you have as wonderful a trip as we did!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2197441453988266/", "likes": 219, "comments": [{"username": "Melissa Cortez", "comment_text": "Mobile passport control app?

If you go around Cagliari and like historical sites, I'd suggest you to stop in Barumini to Su Nuraxi (great example of the nuragical civilization) and Nora archeological site. You'll find plenty of places to eat in Cagliari, but I'll definitely suggest \"Ci pensa Cannas\" - it is a very down-to-earth place where you can enjoy yummy fish dishes for a good price.

I just came back from 13 amazing days in Italy and wanted to provide some tips and insights that I learned while there. We did 4 days in Rome and then 7 days in Amalfi coast (our house we stayed at was actually Massa Lubrenese which is quieter, then did day trips). We were there the first two weeks of July and it was HOTTTT. Granted it was a heat wave affecting Spain and Europe, high 80s and high humidity percentage each day (60-75%) making it feel hotter.\n\nWe landed in Naples airport and took a taxi to our Rome hotel, it was easy and a quick 10 mins drive. We got the ground running, saw the Trevi fountain, Piazza Novana, & Pantheon. All three of those are super close to each other. And there are PLENTY of restaurants for lunch or dinner around that area.\nNext day was the Vatican tour. We chose the private tour our travel agent booked for us. We got there the second they opened to beat the heat. It was a 4 hour tour of the Vatican museum, Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.\n* Few things here. Get water once you go through security and use the bathroom. They have vending machines with water right when you walk in. They\u2019re no fountains here to fill up reusables.\n* It\u2019s hot, no AC. Wear cool clothes. I wore a dress that was light weight material that covered my knees and brought a sweater to put over my shoulders for the Chapel and Basilica. My boyfriend wore light weight pants (have to cover knees) and a shirt sleeve button up, also lightweight material.\nAfter the tour, it was about 12:30 and we grabbed lunch at Bar Vitti in Piazza San Lorenzo in Lucina. It was soo soo yummy, they have gluten free options as well if that is a concern for you, (my bf is celiac)The Spanish steps are also over here along with high end shops like Louis Vuitton.\n\nNext day was The Colosseum, Rome Forum, & Palatine hill. Words cannot describe how beautiful this tour was. But also, words cannot describe how hot it was. There\u2019s limited to no shade throughout this whole tour. There are fountains where you can fill up your water bottles which was nice. But if you can go as early as possible, because by the time we got out around 11:30 or 12, the heat and sun was almost unbearable.\n\nOur last day in Rome we saved for shopping and casually roaming the streets with no set time schedule. I did schedule an appointment to go into the Louis Vuitton store because there was some thing I wanted to buy, I do recommend scheduling an appointment if you are interested in doing that.\n\nWe left for Amalfi by train from Rome to Napoli Centrale, it was an hour train ride non stop. So easy, makes penn station look mediocre if you\u2019re from New York, or New Jersey, you know what I mean.\n\nOur house was in Massa Lubrenese, which was about an hour and a half from Naples.\nIt was supposed to be 30 mins from Sorrento and 60 mins from Positano. But traffic during July and august are HORRIFIC. Taxis are suspended so you have to rely on private car services or public transport.\n\nFirst day we chartered a private yacht that took us around the island of Capri. We also did the blue grotto tour, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nDay 2 tour of Pompeii, highly recommend also VERY VERY hot.\n\nDay 3 we got on the ferry from Positano, and toured Ischia. Could\u2019ve skipped this day but it was beautiful.\n\nDay 4 Sorrento. Perfect for shopping, we ate at Donna Sofia, which was sooo good. The whole restaurant is an ode to Sofia Loren.\n\nDay 5 Positano, Pupetto Beach club on Fornilo Beach. AMAZING. 60 euro per person, we had to lounge chairs and an umbrella. You get a waiter to bring you food and take orders. The food itself was pretty reasonable. We had a total of four alcoholic drinks, two bottles of water to lunch, entr\u00e9es and french fries and it came to \u20ac150.\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask me any questions.

You will pay a fee however it is still less than buying euro in the banks in Australia, and exchange rates in airports are terrible, exchanging in Italy is also expensive. Talk to your bank, there are some cards which offer cheaper rates. However it doesn't cost that much to make a few withdrawals, factor in $100 au for the 4 weeks, for the convenience of not carrying hundreds of Euro around and you get the conversion rate on the day, sometimes it's up, sometimes down, luck of the draw. Holidays cost money, it's just one of the things you will have to factor in. A cup of coffee is less than $3 in a most places away from the monuments, that alone will save you money, pay cash for things like coffee etc, you shouldn't pull out your card for small purchases. They will love you if you use small change to purchase.
