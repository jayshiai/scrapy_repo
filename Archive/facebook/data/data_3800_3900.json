I\u2019ve done both coasts but not the furthest south, \ufffcwhich I hear Sicily is amazing!!! Off the beaten path but accessible via train- Sperlonga, Gaeta, Pescara and am currently in Lido di Jesolo near Venice. Venice should not be missed in my opinion. Rome is best enjoyed very early morning or hit sites late at night for some great pictures. Traveling south you should hit Pompeii. Amalfi. Sorrento and the islands Procida or Capri. Naples has my heart but many\ufffc don\u2019t like its chaos. You will get the best seafood and pizza there (ricotta, mozzarella di buffala and salami).

It happens more and more often now: many arrive attracted by social media, without information, with unrealistic expectations and confused ideas about what they really want to do. Someone asks to go around the lake on foot, it's 160 km, it's impossible!
