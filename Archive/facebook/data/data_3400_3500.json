Don\u2019t try to make the time fit your ideal itinerary. Because most things can be done, at least logistically. So you\u2019d be able to get to all these places in the time indicated but you certainly won\u2019t have enough time to explore them or to get to know them in any meaningful way. You\u2019ll spend too great a portion of your time transiting from location to location to actually absorb the charm of any place.\n\nEveryone\u2019s different of course but I don\u2019t go abroad to spend my time on trains, on planes, or in a car. I go to experience a different culture, to learn new things, to be enriched, and to enjoy myself. Those things happen from \u201cboots on the ground exploration,\u201d\nnot from rushed transiting around.\n\nKeep in mind that there\u2019s a huge difference between \u201cseeing\u201d something and experiencing it. An itinerary that crams too many places into too few days doesn\u2019t allow for much experiencing. You might have the time to rush from one tourist spot to the next so you can wrap things up in that location just to move on to the next location that you\u2019ll also have to rush through to move onto your next stop. In my book that\u2019s just not pleasant. To let these places work their magic on you you should slow it down a bit. Allow yourself the time to do these types of things; 1. to stroll various neighborhoods at will with no goal in mind, just absorbing the unique charm. 2. To watch a sunset. 3. To enjoy a drink while people watching on a busy piazza. 4. To strike up conversations with locals. 5. To sample every gelato shop you stumble on. 6. To pop into any little mom and pop store that interests you. 7. To wander narrow twisty streets at night until you\u2019re hopelessly lost, then to somehow miraculously find your way back. 8. To detour from your itinerary when something unexpected interests you. And 9. To kick a soccer ball around with a group of kids. These are the things that you sacrifice by moving too quickly. They might seem like small things but when you look back on your travels you find they\u2019re somehow the most important things. These are the things that are fun. That you\u2019ll enjoy doing. Rushing around to see the so called highlights isn\u2019t very much fun & is actually stressful and causes exhaustion.\n\nFor what they\u2019re worth these are my thoughts\n\nSince you\u2019re landing in & leaving from Venice it only makes sense to spend some time in this magical, mystical place. You\u2019re landing there so you can visit it without incurring any additional transportation costs or wasting additional hours transiting to it. You\u2019ll be landing in a unique place that\u2019s one of the most visually stunning cities in the world. So spend a couple days having fun there!!\n\nFlorence and Rome also each deserve more time. (And most importantly, you yourself deserve more time in each amazing place.) So I\u2019d eliminate the Amslfi Coast. Not because I don\u2019t like it, because I do, but because it\u2019s geographically the outlier here. It\u2019s not near your other target locations so going there will make it take longer to get back to Venice for your return flight. Eliminating your farthest flung destination will mean fewer hours spent in transit and more hours available for exploration elsewhere. Plus you\u2019d have two days to pay with. I\u2019d add one of those days to Venice and 1 to Florence. I honestly think you\u2019d enjoy yourself much more that way.\n\nOne thing to remember is to account for travel time when planning. Each time you change cities you\u2019re going to lose one half to one full day of sightseeing time. You have to add the actual number of scheduled travel hours (say two by train just as an example) to the time it takes to check out of one hotel and travel to the station. Then add the time it takes to travel through the streets of an unfamiliar city to get to your next hotel and check in. In even the best case scenario thst two hour train ride actually takes up a good 4 hours of the day. And quite often you won\u2019t have the best case scenario. Because trains, planes, etc can be delayed or run late, you might encounter a train strike. You might hit a traffic congestion getting to your new hotel. So depending on how things go the 2 days you\u2019re allotting to Florence, for example, will actually only be 1 and a half days of sightseeing. And you lose that much time (or probably more) each and every time you change cities.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be negative but I thing it\u2019s important you understand the realities of so much transiting around.\n\nNo one can do everything on any one trip. The key to a successful trip is to do as much as you can realistically do while still having fun in each place. I think your itinerary doesn\u2019t allow for much fun so it should be tweaked to allow time for that.\n\nBut again everyone\u2019s different. You have to design an itinerary that suits you."}, {"username": "Lucrezia Folger", "comment_text": "Skip Amalfi Coast. You'll be back.

I loved this group it made the build up to the holiday more exciting if that's possible. All I can offer is that remember everyone's experience will be different as they are staying in different parts of Italy. Your perspective is everything go with the flow and enjoy your break in one of the most beautiful cities. On our trip we had nothing booked but managed we got a two day hop on hop off bus to find out bearings and succeeded in doing most of the big sights like the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, Roman Forum, the Vatican city, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and so much more in between which were all amazing. A massive highlight for me was Villa Borghese this is a fabulous park in the centre of Rome. My husband is a runner and wanted to experience a run abroad so we headed to the park where he proceeded to do his 10k madness I know not for everyone but myself and my daughter scrolled around the park. After a quick stop back at the hotel for his shower we went back to Villa Borghese where we spent the afternoon taking a trip on the little train around the park, a boat trip on the lake which I loved, we visited the Borghese gallery ate lots of gelato. You can also hire bikes golf carts visit the zoo etc. Definitely worth taking time away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We also took a trip out to The Olympic Stadium home to Roma and Lazio which was very reasonable for any football fans. My husband likes to visit the major stadiums in any big cities we visit. Other than that we just scrolled around Italy soaking in the atmosphere, eating and drinking all the fabulous tastes of Italy. I highly recommend if you're visiting Trevi Fountain to eat Pinsitaly Trevi via della Panetteria 12, an absolute gem of a restaurant with very friendly staff and very reasonable. Also we had a fabulous meal at Andrea via Castelfidardo, 30 Roma. The best tip is to bring a bottle to keep refilling at the many fountains around an absolute life saver in the heat. Clocking up Over 20,000 steps a day you will enjoy every pizza, pasta, and gelato you consume.

This was my husband\u2019s first time and my second trip to Italy. Here\u2019s how our trip went and places we\u2019ve stayed and love.\n\nFlew direct Yul-Fco with AC no problem at all even got in early. Stayed in Rome 2 nights at the Damaso Hotel; super central hotel, right by Campo do Fiore, beautiful, amazing staff, highly recommended it. We Armando del Pantheon, this is probably the only place our hole trip that I do not recommend; pasta was extremely salty and overall food not good; it\u2019s clearly become a tourist trap. Had dinner at Pianostrada Laboratorio Di Cucina; beautiful terrace garden and food was great. We did the Vatican 730am breakfast tour; a must, we were all by ourselves with our group in each hall way, yes to see the Basilica we had to go back through the museum with all the people but we simply walked at a fast pasted and got to the side chapel door in about 10 minutes and were able to cut the huge line waiting to get in. Had lunch that day in the basement cellar of Roscioli; amazing, we loved everything we ate and the setting is pretty cool. We then had the night tour of the Colosseum underground that we booked with Get Your Guide ; we were lucky enough ours wasn\u2019t cancel, but I could suggest booking directly with the actual tour company called \u00ab Italy With Family \u00bb, I think your chance of cancellation will be less. We had also book an Italian tour directly with the colosseum just in case but we\u2019re lucky we didn\u2019t need it.\n\nThen took a morning train with Italo from Rome to Florence. I highly suggest booking with Italo. Someone on here had complained about the AC on the trainitalia, well this wasn\u2019t an issue on Italo, the train was basically empty in primo class, train seemed new and ac worked great.\n\nArrived at the Florence terminal we jumped in a cab and headed to Tuscany. I had done a tone of research trying to find the perfect place to stay and let me tell you, I did!! We had a 2 night romance package at this incredible estate called \u00ab Torre a Cona \u00bb (or Fattoria Torre a Cona). The vineyard itself has existed for hundreds of years but the estate was transformed into this incredible small hotel and restaurant with a Michelin star chef. The property is simply wonderful with a beautiful pool. I would highly suggest staying here soon before they become highly popular, as I\u2019m sure their prices will go up.\n\nWe didn\u2019t want to drive and prices for a driver were to us outrageous, so we took taxis everywhere and it worked out great. We did a wine tour with dinner pairing at our estate, a wine tour of Antinori nel Classico Chianti (highly recommend) and we had dinner at Ruffino winery (dinner was alright, over priced and not our best meal but the gardens with table and music are magical; would suggest going for a drink and appetizers in their gardens only).\n\nWe then had a taxi come pick us up at 6am to take us to Florence where we were to catch a bus tour to Cinque Terre. Even though the tour company said we could bring our luggage on the bus, we opted to drop them off at our hotel first; oh how happy we did. The meeting point is at the train terminal but because buses aren\u2019t allowed at the terminal, they make you walk 10-15 minutes away.\n\nThe tour of Cinque Terre itself is about 12-14 hours there and back. The guides were amazing. They give you the train ticket at the beginning, take you from one town to an other with some info of each town and some free time. Unfortunately the day we were there the sea was extremely rough and our boat part of the tour was cancelled; meaning we lost a bit of that feel/charm of what Cinque Terre really is, but on the last town you really get to experience seeing all the colored homes. The tour was great, but because I had been to the Amalfi coast in the past I would now choose to go back to the amalfi coast over cinque Terre as I find it is simply not as well maintained.\n\nBack to Florence at 9pm, this is where we wished we had had at least a full day in Florence. The people are all so nice the city very charming. But from 9-midnight we made the best of it by eating at this restaurant right next to our hotel called Yellow Bar; OMG best best pasta of our hole trip. My husband even said at the end of our trip that he wished he could just go back there and have one more meal. We stayed at Hotel Cavour; beautiful hotel right by the duomo. We had made a rooftop reservation for 10pm so we could at least have a view of the city; incredible!\n\nShort night sleep, 4 am taxi to the airport to catch our flight to Sardinia. 3 nights at the Hotel Villa Margherita in Golfo Aranci. We again didn\u2019t drive and took a taxi to other beaches, but here during the day you could probably safely drive and see tons of incredible beaches. There\u2019s a well known pizza restaurant called Pizzaria La PechoraViziosa; amazing pizza and even better ambiance (highly suggest making a reservation for upstairs). Sardinia is a beautiful island with thousands of options to stay. Next time we would love to try south, but anywhere the water and sand is simply breathtaking.\n\nFinally, back to the airport by taxi; flew Sardinia-Rome then Rome-Montreal.\n\nWe were the lucky ones, zero delays and everything went without a hitch. We never saw one pick pocket (and I\u2019m a traveler and very aware). Never had to use a toilet without a toilet seat. Was hot only the 2 days in Rome as we were there at the end of the heat wave but then the temperature went back down to normal summer temp. We never found it over crowded; the ones that think haven\u2019t travelled much as there\u2019s way worst out there.\n\nDo what\u2019s right for you. If your nervous about things like getting somewhere then give yourself some extra time. I go to Europe every couple of years and the people, the food, the landscapes are all always magical and good for the soul. Don\u2019t let anything ruin that moment, take it all in.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2202958520103226/", "likes": 27, "comments": [{"username": "Michelle Fuger", "comment_text": "Les photos tres belles et je suis contente que vous avez eu un tres beau voyage"}, {"username": "Cathy Stewart", "comment_text": "Ahh, your post makes me excited to go later this year!

Since during weekends or specific days you might be stuck for hours as roads are very small.\n\nAmalfi coast is another one hourish drive from Sorrento (again depending on traffic). Amalfi Coast is not part of Naples, but it's under the province of Salerno (as mentioned by another Italian who commented the post).\n\nAmalfi (which is located in the middle of the coast) coast goes from Positano to Vietri Sul Mare (closer to Salerno). And on the coast there are several little towns other than these 3 (Praiano, Maiori, Minori, Cetara, etc). All alternative (and more cheaper) places where you can stay. Also Salerno would be a good option.\n\nIf you have no intention to visit the city of Naples ( whick is a pity) I would not recommend to sleep in Naples one night and then travel the next day, loosing half a day.

It is quieter and not as upscale, but extremely pretty, too. An advantage of staying in Santa Margherita over the Cinque Terre is that parking is much more available. Also, the town is relatively flat, making it much easier to navigate with children and strollers.\nPortofino: Walk there along seaside, 55 minutes (beautiful!)\nCamogli: 10-minute train ride. Good beach.\nCinque Terre villages: About an hour by train from Santa Margherita. Limit yourself to two villages a day. Prettiest villages (in my opinion): Manarola, Riomaggiore, Vernazza (in that order). There is some magnificent hiking there, but the hikes are somewhat challenging. One path, the Via dell\u2019Amore, is easy, but it has been closed and under repair for several years after heavy rains and a landslide. Monterosso al Mare is the only Cinque Terre village with some parking and a decent beach.
