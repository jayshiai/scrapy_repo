I feel like there\u2019s more to do and see personally\ud83e\udd0d (I\u2019ve just recently visited the North of the Lake as well as the south). You can also visit Verona in 30 minutes from Garda, or Venice in about 1.5 hours. Also with Lake Garda/Como you\u2019d need to decide which area of the lake you want to stay in! For Como for example I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s better to stay in Bellagio or Varenna.\n\nIt depends on what YOU want to see and do though because you could easily spend all those 9 days in Rome exploring the whole city and the areas beyond (using Rome as your base). If you want to truly experience the city, I\u2019d recommend at least 4 days there.\n\nDepending on how much you want to see/do in Florence, you can even take a day trip there from Rome - the fast trains can take only 1.5 hours to get there.\n\nWhilst I\u2019ve not been to Positano I\u2019ve heard it can be very expensive/it\u2019s overrated (though again I can\u2019t properly comment!) I have been to Salerno in the south though and it was beautiful and very easy to make day trips to the Amalfi Coast and areas along there (also Pompeii if you\u2019re interested in that).\n\nInstead of Positano - if you wanted to enjoy the sea/scenic locations, there\u2019s a beautiful island just off Rome called Monte Argentario which is stunning, and then there\u2019s also plenty of beautiful beaches along the Ligurian coast such as Portofino so maybe have a look at there! It\u2019s also more North so will be easier to get to from Florence/head to Como or other places you want to visit.\n\nIf I was to create an itinery based off what I\u2019ve just said and what you want to see I\u2019d suggest:\n\n4 days Rome (including a day trip to Florence)\n2 days at the Ligurian coast (staying in a beach town/in or near Portofino)\n3 days in Lake Garda (including maybe a day trip to Verona if that\u2019s what you were interested in).\n\nLike I said before, it depends what YOU want to do! What are you interested in most and want to see? Are you okay travelling sometimes 2 hour+ journeys every other day to get to the next place? Maybe do a little more research into the areas you\u2019re interested in and see what you think\ud83e\udd70\n\nFeel free to drop me a DM with any questions, I\u2019ve been to Italy a good amount of times now/travelled through the country and love the country so I\u2019m more than happy to talk about it!

I'd suggest Varenna on Lake Como as it's easy to get to/from and is a good base. Plenty of people say skip Milan and if that means spending more time in the CT you could take it off your itinerary but it's a nice city with some great attractions. If pressed for time you could maybe have one night there (depending on arrival time). I haven't been to Naples so can't comment but 5 nights in Sorrento will give you plenty of time to explore the Amalfi Coast/Capri.

There were so many requests so hope that is ok.\n\nVenice - we stayed on the island. The Airbnb was beautiful and on the canal. We had to catch a waterbus across to the mainland, which was no problem but it was \u20ac9.50 each way. The villa had one double bedroom and 2 singles were in the living room, along with chairs and a table - it worked ok. There was one bathroom. It was a short walk to a co-op and restaurants. If you want a quiet stay, this is the place. Very clean and host was very helpful. Waterbus also takes you back to the train Termini. Eating was reasonably priced.\n\nCalle delle erbe\nGiudecca, Venice, 30133, Italy\n\nFlorence - we stayed at Plus Florence which is a hostel but we had a private room with 4 single beds and a huge private ensuite. It was about a 10 min walk to the main Termini. The buffet breakfast is cheap. Very close to the markets. A bit of a walk to the pointe vecchio but we stopped along the way for a drink etc. The pool gets busy and very popular with the 20ish year olds but they were no bother. We are a family of 4 and there were other families there.\n\nPlus Florence\nVia Santa Caterina D'Alessandria 15, Florence, 50129, Italy\n\nRome - we stayed in the Vatican area which was not our initial choice but our original accommodation was cancelled on us so we were left with whatever was available on our budget. This apartment is immaculate! 3 double rooms all with ensuites. Great air con. Short walk to the metro which made it very easy to get around. Many restaurants around the area but didn\u2019t offer a great deal if you\u2019re looking to shop. There were markets nearby which offered some cheap clothing. The apartment exceeded our expectations. Host was very easy to deal with.\n\nVatican Townhouse\nViale Giulio Cesare, Vaticano Prati , Rome, 00192, Italy\n\nHope that helps.

It\u2019s so disappointing when things don\u2019t live up to our expectations.\n\nI think \u201cGrand hotel\u201d is one of those terms that doesn\u2019t have a specific, clearly defined meaning. And that can feel misleading sometimes.\n\nIt seems to me that a lot of old traditional hotels are called Grand Hotels, so that\u2019s what I assume when I hear the name. I automatically substitute \u201cold style\u201d in my mind for the word Grand in a hotel\u2019s name. I visualize an older, historic hotel that was probably top of the line once or architecturally\nsignificant back when it was built. But one that may or may not need updating for current tastes. I think sometimes the best thing about a Grand Hotel might be the location or the view.\n\nBut that\u2019s just me, so who knows?
