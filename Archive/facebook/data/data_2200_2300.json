There have been major advancements in painting restoration in the last 20 years. This is due to a number of factors, including:\n\n* The development of new technologies, such as non-invasive imaging techniques, that allow conservators to see beneath the surface of paintings without damaging them.\n* The increased availability of scientific data about pigments and painting techniques, which helps conservators to make more informed decisions about how to restore paintings.\n* A greater understanding of the causes of deterioration in paintings, which helps conservators to prevent further damage.\n\nAs a result of these advancements, conservators are now able to restore paintings with greater accuracy and subtlety, bringing out the original colors and details in a way that was not possible in the past. This is why you may have noticed a difference in the brightness and vibrancy of the paintings you saw in Italy recently compared to your previous visits.\n\nHere are some specific examples of how painting restoration has improved in recent years:\n\n* In 2002, the Mona Lisa was restored after years of neglect. The restoration revealed that the painting was originally much brighter than it is today, and that it had suffered significant damage from overcleaning and exposure to light.\n* In 2010, the Sistine Chapel was restored after a 20-year project. The restoration cleaned away centuries of soot and grime, revealing the original brilliance of Michelangelo's frescoes.\n* In 2019, the Ghent Altarpiece was restored after a 10-year project. The restoration removed centuries of varnish and overpaint, revealing the original colors and details of the painting.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how painting restoration has improved in recent years. As the field of conservation continues to advance, we can expect to see even more dramatic improvements in the future."}, {"username": "Laura Cary Veeder", "comment_text": "I think so!

And saw it for the second time in 1982. The frescos were dull and dark back then. The colors were kind of muddy. I believe the most recent restoration of it was completed in the 1990s. I was shocked seeing it for the first time after that. The colors were so brilliant and vibrant! Details that hadn\u2019t been visible for hundreds of years were revealed. I remember reading afterward that the restoration caused art historians to reevaluate Michelangelo\u2019s painting. I think there\u2019s still debate, with some believing this restoration finally showed Michelangelo\u2019s techniques while others say the restoration was not true to his intentions.\n\nI\u2019m certainly no expert. All I know is before the restoration I enjoyed the Sistine Chapel mainly for historical reasons. The frescos didn\u2019t really move me. After the restoration, though, I was totally stunned by the power and mastery of Michelangelo. I felt being in the Chapel was to be in the presence of genius.

Try give yourself at least 3 days if possible minimum to enjoy a location and don\u2019t forget a travel day is almost a lost day. Read blogs on locations and narrow down your list.

Tip: if you want to see inside the Colosseum and Vatican, plan in advance. We booked the underground tour through the Colosseum months in advance and it sold out pretty quickly. It was a fabulous tour but \ud83e\udd75! I mistakenly booked it for 2:30-5:30 pm and we were very hot. But it was a very amazing experience nonetheless!\n\nWe also booked a tour through City Wonders to see the Vatican, Sistine Chapel and St Peter\u2019s Basilica. This also sells out. But highly recommend a tour because the guides are so knowledgeable and point out so many things and give you so much history that you just can\u2019t learn from just walking through!\n\nRome is big! There are a lot of different areas unique to themselves. For shopping do some research in advance for your preference. There are high end areas and vintage areas, local areas etc.\n\nFood was delicious of course. So many recommendations I had from this site but because Rome is so big, it was much harder to hit all the spots unlike Florence. We went to Il Felini twice because we loved it so much. A friend of ours who is from Rome recommended a few local spots Romolo e Remo and Mariuccia that were delicious! We ata a lot of gelato. My favorite Come il latte. I had the pistachio which was brown not green. So fresh, nutty and just the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. I ate ALL the pasta, ALL the gelato and didn\u2019t gain a single pound. I think perhaps because of all the walking and the difference in fresh food quality. \ud83e\udd0c\n\nIn any event, eat, drink and live your best life!

Husband actually list 2 pounds. We walked and walked everywhere. We also did the climb up to the Duomo in Florence and the climb up to the Dome of St Peter's and walked up to the Pizzale Castel San Pietro in Verona. So I think k we definitely burned off all the calories from all the delicious food. Also the carbs were much needed for the climbs!"}, {"username": "Gayle Hogg", "comment_text": "WhT a fantastic experience for your boys xx"}, {"username": "Amanda Stewart", "comment_text": "Karen Stewart have you looked at booking us in for the tour for the Colosseum?"}, {"username": "Marcus Hiesler", "comment_text": "Left Roma 2 days ago, were there for 4 days. Totally agree with what you say. Colloseum do early or late. Hop on hop off bus is great and an easy way to get around. See as much as you can walk as much as you can. Use the bus otherwise.
