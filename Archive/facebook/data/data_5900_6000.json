Ushers were standing at the door and prohibiting people from entering who were just there for tourist reasons. They specifically asked if you were there to attend Mass, and only the side chapel where mass was being held was open on that day. No cost to attend. Of course! I would say to just make sure you are going in the correct entrance for Mass - you can ask whichever usher is standing at the door - otherwise, you may end up in a long line of tourists who are just there to view the inside of the church itself."}]}, {"id": "2195289440870134", "text": "Day trip from Florence - deciding between San Gimignano/Siena or San Gimignano/Volterra.
