And also walk along the Arno river for beautiful views sbd cross at least one of the historic bridges. Enjoy great gelato. (Coltelli and Tartufo 13 Gelaterias are considered to have some of the best gelato in all of Italy. Pisa features one of those beautiful public squares that Italy does so well. the Piazza Cavalieri was designed by Vasari and is lined with impressive historic buildings. The Palazzo Blu Is a great art musrum inside a stunning 16th century palace. Check out the tiny gothic church of Santa Maria della Spina. This place is real jewel-like gem. To contrast with the historic sights you might want to see Tuttomundo, a modern, colorful street mural by Keith Harding. The botanical gardens of Pisa were started by the Medici family and are now considered to be the finest botanical gardens in Italy and all of Europe. There are several historic churches worth a visit. Borgo Stretto is an important shopping street if you\u2019re interested in that. If you\u2019re not shopping it\u2019s still worth it to see the stone archways and the colonnaded shops. Plus the beautiful townhouses painted in shades of terracotta and pink that have hanging wash are just so picturesque!\n\nThese are just a few of the many worthwhile sights that I hope you get to see.

This group has been so helpful and I\u2019ve made progress but am now getting overwhelmed and not sure if this is a good itinerary.

My husband lived there as a baby and\u0906\u0923\u0916\u0940 wants to take our daughters. Fly from Split to Rome since only direct flight and then another flight to Florence where we will be for 4 nights. Then train to Naples and private driver to Sorrento and Amalfi coast for 4 nights. I really want to end in Taormina as my family is Sicilian so we would fly from Naples to Catania and drive to Taormina. Is this too much flying while there?

A third one from Split to Rome. Another Naples to Catania. And presumably one from Catania to Rome and then back to US. Six planes or so are do-able. One of the bigger issues might be delays and cancellations and how that sets your plans back. For example, we usually go to Rome a day before our return flights to the US, partly because the discount carrier from Sicily isn't going to protect us if we miss our Rome transatlantic connection. This sounds to us like two trips, and there is so much to see and do in Croatia and nearby Montenegro. And, also so much to see and do in Italy and Sicily. We have done many crazy trips (16 countries in 30 days) and last year Greek islands, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, and Sicily and back to interior Greece, but I think that was a month, so if you are going to do it, please travel with only carry-ons and backpacks.

I think they offer much better views and sea and sun to boot. I'm not a fan of driving on the Amalfi Coast, and I cannot comment on the traffic in October--only in summer--but here are my views: Should I drive on the Amalfi Coast?\nEveryone has their own opinion about renting cars in the Amalfi Coast area. I have done it twice. The traffic moves at a snail\u2019s pace. You often get stuck, unable to pass, behind a truck or bus, breathing diesel fumes. The roads are narrow\u2014often only 1-1/2 lanes wide. There are many curves. When tour buses come around those curves, they frequently cut the corners and don\u2019t really care about other drivers in the other lane. The winding roads resulted in my passengers getting motion sickness. Parking is very, very difficult to find anywhere near a village. You may think you are going to have great views from the road, but often the bushes are too high and obstruct your view. The few vantage points there are are generally so packed with cars that you can\u2019t stop. Last, but not least, because of the horrendous traffic, the local government is going to restrict rental car use. It is my understanding that it will be something like Mexico City, where you can drive on limited days according to your license plate. If you are adventurous and decide to rent a car anyway, be sure it is a small one with full insurance coverage to cover dings and dents. Also, valet parking through your hotel is a must. I personally love riding the ferries from one village to the next. It is my very favorite thing to do there. They give you sea and sun and a unique view of the coastline.\n\nVideo to watch: Driving on the Amalfi Coast (Take out the spaces to connect to link.)\nhttps: // youtu . be /\nD-pqkdFF7zE?t=45"}]}, {"id": "2213253022407109", "text": "", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2213253022407109/", "likes": 9, "comments": []}, {"id": "2208469319552146", "text": "I have a 30 minute drive to drop a car off at the Florence airport and take a taxi to the S.
