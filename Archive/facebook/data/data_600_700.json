Don't get the car until after Florence. A car in the big cities can be a nightmare. So maybe get rid of in Rome?\nHere is a possible itinerary for your 15-20 day trip to Italy, starting in Florence and ending in Rome:\n\n* Day 1: Arrive in Florence and check into your hotel. Spend the afternoon exploring the city center, including the Piazza del Duomo, the Uffizi Gallery, and the Ponte Vecchio.\n[Image of Florence Piazza del Duomo]\n[Image of Florence Uffizi Gallery]\n[Image of Florence Ponte Vecchio]\n* Day 2: Take a day trip to Siena, a beautiful medieval town in Tuscany. Climb the steps to the top of the Piazza del Campo for stunning views of the city.\n[Image of Siena Piazza del Campo]\n* Day 3: Drive to the Cinque Terre, a group of five villages perched on the cliffs along the Italian Riviera. Hike between the villages, go swimming in the Mediterranean Sea, and enjoy the stunning views.\n[Image of Cinque Terre villages]\n[Image of Cinque Terre hiking]\n[Image of Cinque Terre swimming]\n* Day 4: Drive to Pisa, home of the Leaning Tower. Spend a few hours exploring the city and climbing the tower.\n[Image of Pisa Leaning Tower]\n* Day 5+: Drive to Lake Como, a beautiful lake in northern Italy. Spend a few days relaxing by the lake, swimming, and hiking in the mountains.\n[Image of Lake Como Italy]. Varenna, Bellagio are fun places to see here.\n* Day 6: Drive to Verona, a city in northeastern Italy famous for its Roman amphitheater and Juliet's balcony.\n[Image of Verona amphitheater]\n[Image of Verona Juliet's balcony]\n* Day 7: Drive to Venice, a city built on canals. Take a gondola ride, explore the Piazza San Marco, and get lost in the maze of narrow streets.\n[Image of Venice gondola ride]\n[Image of Venice Piazza San Marco]\n[Image of Venice narrow streets]\n* Day 8: Take a day trip to the Dolomites, a mountain range in northeastern Italy. Go hiking, biking, or skiing in the mountains.\n[Image of Dolomites mountains]\n* Day 9: Drive to Rome, the capital of Italy. Spend a few days exploring the city's ancient ruins, including the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon.\n[Image of Rome Colosseum]\n[Image of Rome Roman Forum]\n[Image of Rome Pantheon]\n* Day 10: Take a cooking class in Rome and learn how to make traditional Italian dishes.\n* Day 11: Enjoy a leisurely breakfast at your hotel before boarding your cruise.\n\nThis is just a suggestion, of course, and you can adjust the itinerary to fit your interests and time constraints. If you are nervous about driving in Italy, you can always take trains or buses between destinations. However, driving will give you the most flexibility and allow you to see more of the country.\n\nHere are some tips for driving in Italy:\n\n* Be prepared for narrow roads and hairpin turns.\n* Drive slowly and obey the speed limit.\n* Be aware of pedestrians and cyclists.\n* Use your turn signals and don't be afraid to honk your horn.\n* If you get lost, ask for directions at a gas station or tourist information office.\n\nI hope this helps!"}, {"username": "Suzanne Mills", "comment_text": "Train"}, {"username": "Georgeann Farinacci Greene", "comment_text": "Having a car and driving is awesome.

Pre and post app eras! I would go it alone personally if you like travel research. The Cinque Terre is a rather tricky one unless you have good walking legs or stick to boats but my advice if you really want to go there would be stay outside the villages and travel in early or later in the day by train or boat. The villages are lovely in the evenings. Levanto or Santa Marguerita are actually really good places to base yourself that mostly Italians and French frequent. The main thing that can rarely really throw you with trains - apart from not validating a paper ticket before boarding and them not announcing the platform until the very last minute (common so be very prepared, keep your eyes on the boards and know which number train you are on as it wont say your destination name unless its last or only stop) happen either with both agent or self booked and that is the dreaded Italian habit of throwing a \"sciopero\" (strike) into the mix at last minute at which point there is total generalised chaos for everyone - native and tourist. It's happened to me twice but over a 30+ year travel period. In fact on the way to the Cinque Terre from Milan once - a suitcase you can sit on proved to be awfully useful in such circumstances! We got there that night - eventually - and the bit the family now remembers is trying to find somewhere safe to stash the 6 year olds tooth that fell out whilst waiting...proba\nbly eating something sweet and chewy at the time. If you are in Florence make sure you plan time to see Sienna, San Gimigniano and Lucca.

We loved traveling by train! For more information on train travel... I recommend looking at https://\nwww.seat61.com/ We did book all of our own trains. We had 6 different train travel days. I think only one was direct. The others had 2, 3, or even 4 trains. The part that made it difficult was if the first train was delayed, you could miss the next one. We had 2 trains that were delayed enough, that we missed our next train. I had to go online once I knew what time we would be arriving at our connecting destination and book a different train. The real problem is if they are different train companies. So my second train that I had already paid for that we missed, was just lost $, because they were through different train companies. No recourse for delayed trains. I was able to find later trains online easily, and just come up with a plan b on the fly. That was fine and we were able to be flexible. Just a little later to our final destination, and out the $ for the missed train. The other thing to look out for (which I believe you'll find on the seat61 website), is when you take a train into a larger city, for instance, Milan, or Florence. There is more than one train terminal. Check your tickets to find out which train station you will be arriving at, and where the next one departs from. One of our trips brought us into Milano P Garibaldi, and the next train we needed to board left Milano Centrale. I looked up ahead of time how to get from one train station to the other, and how much time that would take. I factored that in when scheduling train times. It is doable.

First know where you want to go. Download the Trenitalia app. (It has an English version). Pick your time. You search from pont A to pont B. Write down the train number!!!! If you have to transfer, meaning switch trains, it will specify that clearly, and you will get separate tickets to print (or save to your phone) for each train, but you will pay for the total trip.\nWhen you get to the rail station there is an electronic monitor just like an airport that lists all the train numbers, time, and what platform the train will be on. Go to that platform and get on your train. Boom. Done.\nI went all over Italy and Switzerland by train. Best thing ever and very reasonably priced. Just write down your train number because the stops, while listed, are trickier to grasp. The origin of the train and final stop are listed most clearly, but the intermediate stops scroll by. If you know your train number, you\u2019re good to go. If you miss your train, or if you are super early, just go to the ticket counter and they\u2019ll swap it out easily. No hassle. If in doubt just ask for help. I had zero problems on the trains.\nAlso allow fun time for boat rides! It\u2019s a beautiful way to see the coastlines or lakes.\n\nConsider less touristy places too, like Tuscany or the Northern lakes. (Unless you love lines and crowds).

The Italian train system is very efficient and easy to use, and there are many different routes and options available.\n\nHere are some tips for booking train travel in Italy:\n\n* Start by planning your itinerary and figuring out which cities you want to visit. Once you know where you're going, you can start looking at train schedules and prices.\n* There are a few different train companies that operate in Italy, so it's important to compare prices before you book. I recommend using a website like Trainline to compare prices from different companies.\n* If you're traveling during the peak season (April-June and September-Octob\ner), it's a good idea to book your train tickets in advance. This will ensure that you get the best prices and that you don't miss out on a train.\n* When you book your tickets, make sure to pay attention to the class of service you want. There are three classes of service on Italian trains: economy, premium, and business. Economy class is the cheapest, but it can be crowded and noisy. Premium class is a bit more expensive, but it offers more legroom and a quieter ride. Business class is the most expensive, but it offers the best amenities, such as free Wi-Fi and access to a lounge.\n* Once you have your tickets, make sure to print them out or save them on your phone. You will need to show your tickets to the conductor when you board the train.\n\nTransfers are just the connections between trains. For example, if you're taking a train from Rome to Florence, you might have to transfer trains in Bologna. The travel agent is probably warning you about transfers because they can be confusing if you're not familiar with the Italian train system. However, they're not really that difficult to figure out. Just make sure to pay attention to the signs and ask for help if you need it.\n\nI think Cinque Terre is a great place to visit, and I don't think the travel agent is wrong about the transportation being difficult. The five villages that make up Cinque Terre are all very small and they're only accessible by foot, train, or boat. The trains are the most efficient way to get around, but they can be crowded and slow. If you're not used to walking, you might find it difficult to get around Cinque Terre.\n\nHowever, I think the difficulty of transportation is part of what makes Cinque Terre so special. It's a very unique place and it's worth the effort to get there. If you're willing to put in a little bit of effort, you'll be rewarded with some amazing views and some truly unforgettable experiences.\n\nHere are some tips for getting around Cinque Terre:\n\n* The Cinque Terre Card is a great way to save money on transportation in Cinque Terre. The card gives you unlimited access to the trains, buses, and boats that serve the five villages.\n* If you're not up for a lot of walking, you can take the Cinque Terre Express Bus. The bus stops at all five villages and it's a great way to see the coast without having to walk.\n* If you're traveling with a group, you can rent a boat. This is a great way to explore the coast at your own pace and to get some amazing views.\n\nI hope this helps!"}, {"username": "Nathan Earl Stellenberg", "comment_text": "The quote I received from travel agent was absurd.
