These seem to be our best option money wise, has anyone done it this way? If so recommendations?\nWe\u2019ll be doing a day tour to Capri from Sorrento and we\u2019ll be doing a day tour to Pompeii from Naples so both of those places are sorted.\nI\u2019ve also looked into hiring a car but then I\u2019ve read about how hard the parking is etc so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good option.\n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ll be heading to Amalfi Coast so I want to get to most out of it as we tend to try new places each time we travel and probably won\u2019t be back for a long time. We also like to keep things on the cheaper side but open to suggestions.\nThank you for any recommendations and/or advice you have!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2192998661099212/", "likes": 10, "comments": [{"username": "Germaine Graham", "comment_text": "We have just had a week exploring the Amalfi coast - Positano and Sorrento as bases and then a mix of ferry and local buses for day trips.

If you're very keen go to Positano for a night or 2 but if you can, spend the money to stay as close to beach as possible. If you can afford it, Luna at Villa Magia for dinner is spectacular!!!\nFerries are easy and busses are ok too, but the roads are crazy and they're busy so we avoided them. In my opinion, the best code of Positano was from the ferry coming in from Sorrento!!

Spend more time in the smaller less visited but still beautiful towns of Atrani, Praiano, & Minori etc. they\u2019re just as pretty as the more visited towns but have somewhat lower prices and fewer crowds. 2. Stayed for more than two nights in gorgeous Ravello. 3. In general stayed longer everywhere\n& not visited any of the towns as a day trip. Because these towns do not show their best face in a short couple of hours.

You can either get tickets online directly from Coopculture when they become available 30 days in advance OR if you have a guide, any guide, they can call Coopculture in advance and reserve spots for you. There is additional availablity that you can't see online that are reserved for guides. Your guide does not come with you, it is done directly through the Colosseum, but for some reason, they are still able to reserve spots for clients. Once the guide reserves the ticket, you call Coopculture directly and pay for it. I don't know the number - you can look it up online.\nSecond, when our guide called to reserve, the only tickets left were in Italian. We got the 9:40 pm slot and when arrived and escorted to the tour area, the Colosseum guide came out and said \"Let me guess, no one on this tour speaks Italian!\" So, the entire tour was conducted in English. I guess it is very common at this point, so don't worry if you only can secure Italian tour tickets. It was great at night and not too hot either! Very worthwhile and took about an hour.
