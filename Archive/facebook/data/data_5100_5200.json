It's been twenty years since we travelled to Europe and so I did need some help to plan and think about all the things that might need some preparation before we left. We have just returned from two weeks in Italy, we picked two locations, the first week was spent relaxing and enjoying Sicilian food, culture, language and beauty in Taormina and the second week was in Rome.\n\nWe flew in to Catania from London late in the evening and found ourselves at midnight feasting on seafood and pizza in the outdoor pub restaurants near the fish market, Catania is always fun, intense, great food! We stayed there one night before and after our main trip to Taormina, so we were close to the airport. Also we were so lucky to avoid any airport closures due to external events (Etna/strike/fire) we didn't have any issues flying in and out of Sicily but I'm always mentally prepared for disruptions so it's good when it goes smoothly.\n\nWe always love staying in Taormina, and this time was perfect. The apartment had three balconies with incredible views of the sea, we went out or cooked with the fresh local food and we walked everywhere. It was pretty hot but we just ate our bodyweight in granita and gelato \ud83d\ude01 wore hats, covered up, kept in the shade and had a day at the beach swimming in the cool waters of Isola Bella. We watched an opera in the Greek Ampitheatre in Taormina on our last night which was very special.\n\nWe flew from Catania to Rome and spent four nights there jam packed full of adventures!\n\nWe stayed near the Borghese gallery in a lovely little three star hotel with great staff in Sallustiano near the embassies. We walked everywhere, this was sometimes overwhelming when it got too hot so at that point we retreated into a cafe and ate and drank cold things in the aircon just to cool off and revitalise ourselves, or we would find an air-conditioned art gallery and just hang out amongst the art for a couple of hours.\n\nBefore I left I managed my expectations with respect to booking tours, I booked with the venues directly and I decided if I couldn't get in that would be fine.\n\nThe Colosseum was the most difficult to secure tickets to but I managed to get the full experience super ticket, with underground tour for 930am through the coop culture website. Honestly I was testing this site out weeks before the date our tickets would be released and I was shocked to get four tickets for that time. The only slight issue was that the tour was only in Italian (there were absolutely no English tours available that I could see), but my daughters were able to translate (high school Italian) and I used Google transcribe (which worked intermittently). This tour was fantastic, I'm so glad we did it. We almost missed it though because most staff there didn't believe /see on our ticket that we had booked tour and we just happened to find someone with the correct information who sent us back to the meeting place for tours. We were so hot after the tour we collapsed in a cafe opposite the Colosseum, spent a small fortune on pancakes in this beautiful air-conditioned place, and once we were rehydrated went on to visit the Roman forum using Rick Steve's tour as a guide. We even got access to the incredible Chiesa di Santa Maria Antiqua with 6th century frescos. So beautiful. We did somehow miss Palatine Hill due to a toilet emergency but by then we had all expired!\n\nI booked directly through the Vatican museum website for the early morning 730am Vatican museum tour with Sistine Chapel and breakfast, this tour was also fantastic with only a couple of other groups there at the same time. This was an English speaking museum guide. The breakfast was good, and afterwards we battled our way back through the throngs of people into St Peter's Basilica where we spent another couple of hours just exploring the church and walking right up to the top of the dome (we took the elevator part of the way) for fantastic views of Rome. Then we walked to Trastevere as we wanted to check this neighbourhood out. We walked along the Tiber river part of the way. We were just so hot at that stage we devoured gelatos at two places in quick succession less than 500m apart and then needed the toilet so we ended up visiting the beautiful Galleria Corsini and spending a few hours in the cool air conditioning. This ticket allowed us to visit the partner Gallery Barberini the next day.\n\nI booked the English speaking guided tour of the Borghese Gallery directly through their website, this tour was also amazing. It was like an art history lesson, and we really loved the Borghese Gallery, it was full of stunning Italian art! We then walked through the park to La Galleria Nazionale, with modern art in a fantastic building, again the air conditioning was sublime!\n\nWhen we first arrived we had a quick walk to visit Fontana di Trevi, Piazza di Spagna and the Spanish steps and the Chiesa della Trinita dei Monti. There was so many people there, but we just kind of launched ourselves into the masses, got our photos and moved onto the next site. This was our introduction to Rome and after that we were fine with huge crowds.\n\nI only booked two restaurants in Taormina, and a rooftop bar in Rome and the rest of the places we ate were places we passed near our accommodation or recommended by our host.\n\nI was worried about thefts, we all had bought cross body bags with extra clips to lock, and passport wallets to hide under our clothes, and we were super vigilant about where our bags were all of the time. Luckily we remained safe, and we didn't see any pickpockets while we were there, I've had that experience with previous trips to other countries so I was preparing myself, but again so lucky that wasn't our experience this time.\n\nWe used our Australian phones, these were not able to replace the Sims or use esims so we added some international roaming travel credit and I also hired WiTourist (recommended on this site) who provided a pocket Wi-fi device. We got the middle of the range model so we never ran out of data, it did run out of battery so they had a heavy portable battery to recharge it on the go (I didn't use this much). Anyway it was excellent for us with coverage in Sicily and Rome. Very easy to use and organise for delivery etc.\n\nWe walked 50km in the last week, it was great being able to get around Rome so easily by foot. I did get blisters and bought replacement blister bandaids there, I have 3B cream for any chafing (excellent) and we all wore sneakers most of the time. I had a linen skirt, trousers, and three dresses, and a shirt to cover my shoulders. My bag was a backpack, it was never more than 11kg and so handy for walking up stairs! My husband took a small carryon. The large suitcase we had was a burden, I wish we had two smaller ones instead. These were for my teenage children, but we know better for next time.\n\nWhat a wonderful experience we had, it was worth the brutal long haul flights from Australia and so amazing to spend time in Italy with our children. We tried to speak Italian everywhere, everyone was kind to us, and we had such a great holiday. I was very grateful for your advice on this group, and hope others have a good experience also in their planning and on their holiday.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2198221627243582/", "likes": 209, "comments": [{"username": "Fiona Cohn", "comment_text": "Fabulous write up Lisa!

I just came back from 13 amazing days in Italy and wanted to provide some tips and insights that I learned while there. We did 4 days in Rome and then 7 days in Amalfi coast (our house we stayed at was actually Massa Lubrenese which is quieter, then did day trips). We were there the first two weeks of July and it was HOTTTT. Granted it was a heat wave affecting Spain and Europe, high 80s and high humidity percentage each day (60-75%) making it feel hotter.\n\nWe landed in Naples airport and took the train to Rome. We got the ground running, saw the Trevi fountain, Piazza Novana, & Pantheon. All three of those are super close to each other. And there are PLENTY of restaurants for lunch or dinner around that area.\nNext day was the Vatican tour. We chose the private tour our travel agent booked for us. We got there the second they opened to beat the heat. It was a 4 hour tour of the Vatican museum, Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.\n* Few things here. Get water once you go through security and use the bathroom. They have vending machines with water right when you walk in. They\u2019re no fountains here to fill up reusables.\n* It\u2019s hot, no AC. Wear cool clothes. I wore a dress that was light weight material that covered my knees and brought a sweater to put over my shoulders for the Chapel and Basilica. My boyfriend wore light weight pants (have to cover knees) and a shirt sleeve button up, also lightweight material.\nAfter the tour, it was about 12:30 and we grabbed lunch at Bar Vitti in Piazza San Lorenzo in Lucina. It was soo soo yummy, they have gluten free options as well if that is a concern for you, (my bf is celiac)The Spanish steps are also over here along with high end shops like Louis Vuitton.\n\nNext day was The Colosseum, Rome Forum, & Palatine hill. Words cannot describe how beautiful this tour was. But also, words cannot describe how hot it was. There\u2019s limited to no shade throughout this whole tour. There are fountains where you can fill up your water bottles which was nice. But if you can go as early as possible, because by the time we got out around 11:30 or 12, the heat and sun was almost unbearable.\n\nOur last day in Rome we saved for shopping and casually roaming the streets with no set time schedule. I did schedule an appointment to go into the Louis Vuitton store because there was some thing I wanted to buy, I do recommend scheduling an appointment if you are interested in doing that.\n\nWe left for Amalfi by train from Rome to Napoli Centrale, it was an hour train ride non stop. So easy, makes penn station look mediocre if you\u2019re from New York, or New Jersey, you know what I mean.\n\nOur house was in Massa Lubrenese, which was about an hour and a half from Naples.\nIt was supposed to be 30 mins from Sorrento and 60 mins from Positano. But traffic during July and august are HORRIFIC. Taxis are suspended so you have to rely on private car services or public transport.\n\nFirst day we chartered a private yacht that took us around the island of Capri. We also did the blue grotto tour, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nDay 2 tour of Pompeii, highly recommend also VERY VERY hot.\n\nDay 3 we got on the ferry from Positano, and toured Ischia. Could\u2019ve skipped this day but it was beautiful.\n\nDay 4 Sorrento. Perfect for shopping, we ate at Donna Sofia, which was sooo good. The whole restaurant is an ode to Sofia Loren.\n\nDay 5 Positano, Pupetto Beach club on Fornilo Beach. AMAZING. 60 euro per person, we had to lounge chairs and an umbrella. You get a waiter to bring you food and take orders. The food itself was pretty reasonable. We had a total of four alcoholic drinks, two bottles of water to lunch, entr\u00e9es and french fries and it came to \u20ac150.\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask me any questions. In the comments you can tag me I may have missed some things. My brain is still on European time so I\u2019m still trying to adjust.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2197264714005940/", "likes": 628, "comments": [{"username": "Terri March", "comment_text": "I\u2019m confused by your comment that you flew in to Naples and then took a taxi to Rome that only took 10 minutes.

Zebra crossing is a suggestion, they do not stop until you take the brave 1st step out.\n5. Get an audio guide for vatican museum. It takes at least 3 hours to brisk walk through and for that, you can't stop at every exhibit. It's very warm and crowded at certain points. Keep calm, keep hydrated. No point having a guide, bcoz of the crowd, they are just herding you through. Just you join a private tour, than its different.\n6. Have loads of pasta! All so nice!\n7. Have loads of gelato, amazing in this weather!\n\nExperience in Procida\n1. Buy bus ticket at port, can't find it anywhere else.\n2. It's very steep, quite a walk, mostly unsheltered.\n3.
