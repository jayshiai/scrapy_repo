The tour was great in providing a \u201cbackbone\u201d , meaning it hit most of the basics for what we wanted to see as first time visitors to Italy. I would recommend to people doing a tour is to read the fine details of your itinerary. We did a lot of really great things but we\u2019re not aware for example that the part in Rome didn\u2019t actually include a tour inside the Colloseum. In Florence we didn\u2019t see the David Statue or go into the Uffizi museum.\nThis isn\u2019t their fault, I just didn\u2019t look closely enough or question the company ahead of time. We didn\u2019t have the time to do those things outside of the tour. Please don\u2019t get me wrong, it was great but if something is important to you research it ahead of time.\nWe did two things on our own which I think may have been my favorites. A private wine tour in Tuscany and a cooking class in Rome, which was incredible. I would highly recommend Cooking Classes in Rome . The chef Andrea Consoli works very hard to make the experience everything you want and also interact on a very personal basis. Outstanding.\nAlso, as I need to eat GF, I was a little worried about Italy. No need to worry, they are very aware and really catered to my needs . Pizza, pasta, desserts and more, all great.\nI\u2019m adding some highlight photos. One request- I want to make 3-4 of these into bigger metal prints. Anyone have a favorite they would suggest?

I personally find Venice tedious and boring so I always say 1 day max, but even a half day. It is nothing but waterways lined with murano glass shops, drama masks, and jewelry. Close to Venice and much more beautiful is Verona. Its shops, restaurants, pace are more relaxed and quaint. Also can take in some famous Shakespeare references, ie, R&J. Close to Verona are also Mantua, Padua, both small and quieter yet very pretty. Also between Florence and Venice is the gastronomic strip Emilia-Romagna with Bologna, Parma, Modena.\n\nYou will have to decide what appeals the most and pick regions to visit, but all roads point to Rome so definitely give it some of your time.\n\nTo the west you have Cinque Terre, similar beauty to Amalfi but a different pace."}, {"username": "Anna Conroy", "comment_text": "I would organize my travels following the Freccia Rossa (bullet train) itinerary.\nExample 1sr week\n.Milan close to Malpensa airport.

Tuesday was a trip to Murano and then on to Venice for the remainder of the day. Wednesday we headed to Assisi for one day/night. Was well worth the trip! Thursday we drove into Rome and made it in time for the Colosseum and Roman Forum tour and then on over to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish steps. Friday was the Pantheon and Vatican City with free time in the afternoon. Saturday we drove to Pompeii which was very interesting. We then flew out early on Sunday. It was a LOT of walking but so worth it! As others have said, you can stay in the cities and venture out from there and I would highly suggest that. If you are not going with a group, I would suggest getting your tickets early or doing the big sites with a tour group as you get in without standing in huge lines and it includes the entry price at a bill rate. We definitely have many more places to see!"}, {"username": "Shelby Musselman Dickman", "comment_text": "We\u2019re doing 10 nights in April for our anniversary. First time to Italy/Europe as well.

One our way home, we decided to check our bags as it was included in our airfare and we bought some souvenirs (including alcohol).\nWe went during a very hot time (temperatures averaged 97 degrees each day). We combatted this by getting out early, sight seeing in the morning, coming home after lunch, taking cold showers, and going back out in the evening. Lots of water, liquid IV, and fans!\nFLORENCE - we spent 4 days in Florence!\nFOOD.... Tamero Pasta Bar and Trattoria CasaLinga. AMAZING food, cheap (and good wine), and really great service. We made a reservation at CasaLinga but not at Tamero.\nEveryone always recommends All'antico Vinaoi for tradition focaccia sandwiches. Not me .... walk a little further and go to Pinos Sandwiches. Shorter line, better sandwiches, cheaper, and your sandwich is made by no one other than Pino himself. He is the sweetest man and loves talking to all us tourists.\nPersonally, I don't think all gelato is created equally. Our favorite was Sbrino. Try to find places that serve gelato out of mental tins with lids. Those are the places that make gelato fresh (this was a tip from our air bib host).\nWe grabbed a drink at Loggia Roof Bar one night before dinner. Drinks were expensive and it was nothing to rave about (sure, the view is nice). If you have time to do it, go for it. But I wouldn't go out of my way to do it again.\nVESPA...we used The Vespa Rent company and it was our most fun day in Florence! We had the vespa for about 7 hours and explored Tuscany. Stopped at multiple wineries, had lunch in Chianti, and got to get out of the city for an entire day. This company is amazing and provides maps for self-guided tours.\nSIGHTSEE...we did the Duomo at 9AM and we were thankful for that. For starters, it wasn't 100 degrees (yet) when we walked the 400 steps to the top AND the square was empty! We got to explore and walk around without thousands of people. 100% recommend the cathedral museum. It's rich in history and amazing (plus, it has AC). Otherwise, we got lost in Florence. Walked around, went into churches, walked down less crowded streets.\nROME - we spent about 48 hours in Rome! Because we were only there for a short time, we stayed in an Air Bnb that was about 5 minutes walking from the Colosseum.\nSIGHTSEE...we purchased the Rome Cards for 48 hours. These include public transportation and it includes entrance into the Colosseum (just have to reserve a time online). We went to the Colosseum at 530PM. We did the Vatican Happy Hour Tour at 7pm. It was awesome. We got a glass of prosecco, some meats and cheeses, and other snacks. Then we got to enjoy the Vatican relatively empty. We saw all the other sights - yes it was crowded, yes it was hot, but there are worst things.\nFOOD...Li Rioni Pizzeria, Il Bocconcino. Both AMAZING and did not require reservations. We ate at Vecchio Roma one night. It was meh. Food was average, service was odd, and it felt very touristy and expensive. The server was annoyed we didn't pay in cash for our 80 euro bill.\nCINQUE TERRE...we spent 4 days in Riomaggiore. Our airbnb was amazing and had a rooftop terrace. Beware: Riomaggiore (and all of the Cinque Terre) is hilly with lots of steps. Pack light. We purchased the Cinque Terre Cards, which includes public transport on the trains and busses (each trip on the train in between towns is 5 euro, just FYI). We went to all 5 towns and even went to La Spezia one morning.\nBEACH\u2026we went to Monterosso and got there around 10AM. We went to a beach and purchased a spot with an umbrella and two chairs. It was 38 euro and 100% worth it. We were able to come and go as we wanted for the entire day. There are free beaches but they are small and have no shade. We left around 6PM. This particular paid beach closed at 7PM. Of note, the paid spots fill up FAST\u2026get there early.\nSNORKELING\u2026we went snorkeling with a local company in Riomaggiore. It was 45 euro and last about 3 hours. We went to three different sports and one of the tour guides pointed out specific fish, coral, and other cool facts about the Cinque Terre.\nWINE TASTING\u2026we went wine tasting at Gheme in Riomaggiore. THE BEST EXPERIENCE. It was 25 euro and we tasted 4 wines plus a sweet dessert wine that only comes from the Cinque Terre. We got an entire history of the area, of wine making, and even got food pairings with each wine. We didn\u2019t want to leave - it was that amazing.\nFOOD\u2026we made most of our meals at home during this part of the trip. We went to the market and got pasta, tomatoes, chicken, mozzarella cheese, salami, focaccia bread, etc. We did go out to Nessun Dorma in Manrola. It\u2019s good, very good. And the view makes it worth it. Pro tip\u2026download the app and get in the queue before even getting there. We went to La Spezia and went to a cafe called Ciao Baby. GO THERE!!!! Literally, go to La Spezia just to go to Ciao Baby. We still talk about the food and lattes.\n\nHappy to try and answer any questions! We were very happy with our trip.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2198770730522005/", "likes": 563, "comments": [{"username": "Mary Andreotta", "comment_text": "Thankyou for the great tips!"}, {"username": "Sabrinna Suzzanne", "comment_text": "Fabulous"}, {"username": "Rebecca Lyon", "comment_text": "Bronte Lyon"}, {"username": "Sheila Tharin Ewing", "comment_text": "What a wonderful trip!

I didn\u2019t mind the early to mid 30s in the first few weeks. Milan was great and would go back in a heartbeat, also didn\u2019t feel overcrowded late June. Definitely have 3-4 days in Milan. Duomo rooftop tour is a must. Last supper was pretty good too. Rome was ok with all the historic places but it felt dirty, graffiti and rubbish everywhere which I don\u2019t recall from many years ago when I last visited. It was disappointing to see. Again lots of tourists given peak season but not a problem for us. We stayed near Piazza Navona. Lots of great restaurants near the square. Did the colosseum underground tour which was fantastic but the Roman forum with that was rushed - may have been our guide that spent lots of time trying to hide under a tree talking rather than letting us explore then we ran out of time as had to get to Colosseum booking. Did the crypt and catacombs tour which was ok - catacombs wasn\u2019t what I expected as just holes in walls. Also took a day tour to Amalfi coast, Positano and Pompeii. That was fantastic although I think reading the reviews it would have been better to spend some time on/near Amalfi coast to spend longer there. Next time! Trevi fountain great early in the morning. Venice was much the same, quite dirty, ok to visit for a day or two but personally wouldn\u2019t spend longer than that. We stayed at San Marco Suite 755 which was great for a family. Gondola rides seemed overpriced (charged 160 euros for 35 mins). Food seemed a little more expensive in Venice. If near Venice try to get to Croatia/\nSlovenia as it is beautiful. That is one place we want to revisit and sail around the islands. After arriving in Greece we started to see how overpriced restaurants were in France and Italy.

Also, unless You visit in July and august, the weather has been quite unpredictable in the last years. This year June has been very rainy and it rained almost every day even in Rome. Last year we visited the Amalfi coast for 3 weeks in September and we had just 1.5 rainy days over 20+ days.\n\nAbsolutely must go places for a first time visitor would be in my opinion: Florence (2 nights), Venice (1-2 nights), Rome (2nights), Amalfi coast (at least 7 nights, divided as follows: 2nights in Vietri, 2nights in Ravello, 2 nights in the praiano/conca dei Marini area, 2nights either Amalfi and Positano). If you have extra time you can also visit Capri (either overnight there or easily reach kt with a ferry from any of the Amalfi coast towns. A good base is also Salerno as very close to the coast and easily reachable through high speed train and car.\nIn any case, I would not choose both amalfi and Positano (to overnight) as they are in my opinion too crowded; you can always visit for a morning/\nafternoon trip. Alle the towns on The coast are quite easily accessible through ferries.\n\nA great place to go too is the Val d\u2019orcia Region, in Tuscany. You find a lot of family owned properties where you can enjoy the best organic food, wine, pool with amazing views on rolling hills.\n\nThough, Italy has so much to see, so it would be helpful to know if you\u2019re more interested in culture, art, food/wine experiences, beach/sea?"}, {"username": "John Layman", "comment_text": "Sept. or April"}, {"username": "Bea Kuckens", "comment_text": "September.
