Remember to book main sites as very long queues will take up too much of your time.There are so many fabulous buildings free to view.in rimini we only paid 2 euros for long bus journeys.The list is endless eat away from the main tourist areas as st marks square completely over the top silly prices 35 euros for a soup just stay aware and act with intelligence and you should have a lovely trip.Its such fun having the adventure im 72 and am having a whale of a time its a dream come true.Enjoy!!"}, {"username": "Doug Burke", "comment_text": "This is going to be an adventure.

So just heads up to those planning to go to Amalfi/positano/Capri and planning to go there via ferry, Have a back up plan or be prepared to go thru hell If this ever happens.
