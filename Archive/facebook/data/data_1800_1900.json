No exceptions.\n\n6) exercise the foot 3-4x day. Stand on the ball of your foot on the edge of a stair w your heel off the step. Hang onto something.

If you can\u2019t do it yourself, ask a loved one for their help.\nOrder would be stretches, exercises, massage, ice.\n\nGood luck. I wouldn\u2019t wish this condition on anyone.

Just Google and several will pop up.. you just need to tip them, but more economical"}, {"username": "Mindy Fey Kinser", "comment_text": "Good for you for asking what everyone REALLY does want to know! Here are a few tips I've picked up - hope they help: (1) Accommodations - if you can stay outside the city center (Rome, Naples, Venice, Florence, etc), you are likely to save $$ but consider the cost of getting around to the sites you want to see as well. I prefer to drive outside of the cities, so vacation rentals have been great. There are SO many to choose from (if you look early) and the prices are typically very good. Decide on your criteria (AC? view? remote/\nnot remote, parking, etc) and search. Most Italian rentals have a \"Name\" (i.e. \"Maria's Bella Vista\"). Google the NAME and you can often find the owner's website. When you book directly with the owner, you often save 10 - 40% and the communication is usually excellent. DO read plenty of reviews (on other sites) first though to be comfortable with what you are getting AND confirm the cancellation policy. I have found most owners to also be very helpful with recommendations of things to do and see off the beaten path. When we were in Tuscany in May, the owner of our villa arranged for 2 women from Lucca to come to the house for a cooking class. Not only was it convenient and cost less than had we booked it through a website, it was the most AMAZING night of our trip - the owner brought his own private wine to share and we all sat around the table enjoying the huge meal and conversation for hours. You can't get that in a pricey hotel. (2) Unless you are going in the VERY busy season (summer), wait until a couple weeks before the trip to book a rental car - prices will be significantly less than booking early. To be on the safe side, I often book early to be certain I have what I want but only book with free cancellation. If the prices drop a lot, rebook. (3) And speaking of that, consider going in November - March when prices are much better, crowds are down, and the weather is still usually pretty darn good. (4) On my last three trips to Italy, I have paid around $50 for my flight (front row, main cabin, with 2 checked bags included and lots of perks out of a mid-market airport) - BECAUSE I use my airline credit card for everything and pay it off each month (you usually get 50,000 miles just for applying and using the card right away). No foreign exchange fees AND I get bonus miles for everything. Yes, it costs me $99/year BUT it includes free trip insurance coverage AND free CDW master rental coverage for the car - those two things alone saved me over $350 on my upcoming trip - and the flight would have been $1450 if I didn't use miles. It makes saying \"Yes, I think I'll go back to Italy\" easy!! (4) Everything in Italy is gorgeous - and so much of it is free to see!! Here are a few of my favorites: (A) In Assisi - the entire village is a wonder. You can spend a day just slowly going from one end to the other enjoying the incredible views and the absolute peace of the place. Plenty of inexpensive shopping and restaurants - and all of the churches, including the magnificent Basilica of San Francesco - which rival most museums - are FREE. (B) Cortona: the village is small and lovely and easy to traverse BUT continue UP the hill to Hermitage \"Le Celle\" the 13th century Franciscan monastery. There is a large parking lot and it is free to enter and wander around this magnificent site in complete peace. The monks are present but silent, and you won't see them. (C) Saturnia: The hot springs are beautiful and relaxing - open 24/7/365 and FREE. (D) Colle di Val d'Elsa - check out the Parco Fluviale (just google it - it's gorgeous!). (E) Madonna della Corona Sanctuary (Spiazzi, near Lake Garda) - it costs nothing to park and walk down the hill to this spectacular church built into the side of the cliff on Monte Baldo. However, you may opt to pay 1.5 euros to catch the shuttle back UP the hill \ud83d\ude09. (5) There are also great experiences you can have for next to nothing: like riding bikes around the city wall in Lucca (2 euros)! (6) For booking major sites, vineyard tours, ferries, etc. whenever possible, use the official site (i.e. The Vatican Museums, San Marco's, etc). Much more affordable and less likely to be cancelled at the last minute. OKAY - this post is too long already so I'll stop and just wish you a great, memorable trip. Don't sweat the small stuff - because it is ALL good!!

Eat at lunchtime & don\u2019t be embarrassed to share a course. Around 6pm most bars in Italy put out little snacks at the bar complimentary with a drink. Use public transport. Book direct with an hotel & negotiate a discount - they pay the booking.conms & other agents 10/15% commission. Eat away from city sights. Do free walking tours.

I do have an AirTag in my bag and I could see that it was in Thessaloniki still. My friend\u2019s bag made it but not mine.\n\nThe next day I got a text from the airline that said they found my bag and to expect a call to arrange delivery method. Two days later, I received an email at 11pm from the lost & found at Fiumicino Airport that they found my bag but don\u2019t have any information otherwise.\n\nI asked if it was possible to receive my bag in Rome since we were leaving for Cinque Terre the following morning. They replied that the courier wouldn\u2019t make it in time and asked if I could come back and collect (and that their office was open at 7:30am). I was unable to make this happen since we had a train to catch and replied as such.\n\nSince we settled in Cinque Terre, I\u2019ve attempted to reach out again but there is no response. I\u2019ve emailed and called the number provided numerous times. All I get is a busy tone or \u201call our operators are currently busy\u201d.\n\nSorry this is a long post but I\u2019m just really lost and unsure what to do. \ud83d\ude1e We have 6 days left in Italy before I fly back to the states but we\u2019ll be constantly moving (with our last stop in Venice).

Sad to see number of tourists leaving garbage on ground and window ledges. The city needs to step up litter clean up to help. That said we knew it would be busy and planned to visit other sites and we had great luck and really enjoyed:\n\nPalazzo Doria Pamphilij on via del Corso beautiful private small palace. Get the audio guide! No advance tickets needed.\n\nPalacio Colonna - another private palace. Only open Friday and Saturday mornings. Get ticket with garden. Stunning.\n\nMusuem of Baths of Diocletian - great musuem. Not busy at all but not well air conditioned.\n\nSpada gallery we found, it\u2019s small but only 6 euros. It was fine for the price.\n\nNational Gallery of Ancient Art at Barberini Palace. Stunning also and no advance ticket needed.\n\nDid an online self pace walking tour of Trastevere and had a great time exploring side streets, seeing makers of the homes of lost Jewish families and visiting some quiet churches.\n\nWe did pre-book the early morning Vatican tour that included a breakfast in the garden and that was awesome.\n\nNo issue with Uber which ordered you a taxi.\nAlso grabbed scooters that are all over city to rent.\n\nEating: do not eat at La Canonica in trastevere. It is a factory and food is on par with Olive Garden, nothing special.\n\nMimi e Coco for drinks and a meat and cheese platter in Trastevere was a great experience.\n\nReally enjoyed a casual meal at Ai Balestrari, the suppli were really good and great pizza.\n\n", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2207928952939516/", "likes": 0, "comments": []}, {"id": "2207937449605333", "text": "Curious to see how luggage might be stored on the trains.
