Florence is a good central location to the Tuscany region. Venice has some easy day trips by train or vaporetto. Get the vaporetto pass and use it, will save a lot of walking over lots of bridges. Rome is easily a week with a lot of walking so a good central location is the Monti area or the Pantheon area. The Monti area is closer to the train station and bus depot so easy to move around that way. Pompeii is a day train trip from Rome. Look at the FB site Romewise for lots of tips on Rome and Florencewise for that city. Another easy day trip by train from Rome is Orvieto to get that Etruscan experience. Look at the site Rome2Rio for train travel, distance, time and price. I understand budget and appreciate trying to stay in one. You can take a night train from Munich to Venice, but you won't see much, or you can do a day train with several changes. Sometimes a few more dollars spent will be cheaper because of convenience and time. Flying directly to where you want to go and leaving from where you want to end, it is pricier, but will give you more time to play. Just do a lot of research and get prices so you have an idea of the daily cost.

In a bar or cafeteria you can drink from your own bottle of water but order something else in the meantime. In the southern Italy they will provide you with a free glass of water in bars and cafeteria.\n2-in Italy people order one big individual dish and then, if they want, they let the other people taste a bite from their plate. Is some Pizzerias they do \"Giropizza\" and the pizzaiolo decides which pizzas to make and you receive several different slices of pizza, but in Naples for example there are only two traditional pizza tastes, Margherita and Marinara so better stick to these two kinds that are amazing. It is true that you can share the same dish with another person but it is considered rude to do this for more that one serving (we tend to divide dinner in Antipasto, Primo, Secondo and Dolce even if one can order just a Primo or a Secondo or just an Antipasto and a Dolce).\n3- public toilets in big cities are usually quite clean. In little towns better go in a cafeteria, drink a coffee or a juice and go at theirs. In supermarkets and shops there are almost never toilets (I remember them only in huge malls and at Aldi's and Lidl's).\n4-trash cans everywhere\n5- when you enter a place say out loud : Buongiorno/ Sera or Salve even in a Shop, museum hall, restaurant or bar, you can wave in English too; in summer we tend to drink iced drinks ( I know in China for example people prefer hot water) so asking for hot drinks would be perceived as uncommon but bartenders will do it as soon as they are sure of having understood well the order; in Italian cities near city centers there are plenty of bars and restaurants for tourists, so if you want to try authentic Florence/Rome/\nMilan /Venice food you'd better ask locals or move out from the center.\nWe eat, in the north, at noon for lunch and at 7/7,30 for dinner; in the south between 1 p.m/3 p.m for lunch and between 8,30 p.m and 11 p.m for dinner. German tourists that go on holiday where I live (Lake Maggiore, Piedmont) eat at 6 p.m, restaurants now known it and accept it. We don't like american style but I don't agree with somebody here that suggested you not to wear caps or socks and sandals. Do as you want, but of course Italians understand you are a tourist so maybe they will offer you to buy food or drink or supplies you don't need...
