I am a mom of two little kids and I don\u2019t stay up late or party much. \ud83d\ude06\n-Depart US at 2:45. Take melatonin and try to sleep on the plane (hoping to fall asleep around 7pm Texas time. Will try to be falling asleep by 8pm a few nights before we leave).\n\nDay 1\n-Land in Rome 8:00am (1am to us), leave bags with hotel in piazza navona, go to a cafe/hang/explore. Go with rome time. No naps.\n- do Heart of Rome walk around sunset, spend about 2 hours: Shop, visit pantheon, Jewish ghetto, end in campo di fiori for dinner. (Or maybe do it backwards and end for dinner at Spanish steps area?)\n\nDay 2:\n-prime experience Vatican tour with breakfast. (Already booked)\n-Check out of hotel, board train to Naples, stop long enough to have pizza.\n-private car pick up to take us to hotel de la ville. Check in, relax, explore Sorrento, beach maybe?\n\nDay 3: Amalfi\n- this is still very up in the air. I think we\u2019ll ferry out to see the view of the coast from the water. Then start in amalfi/bus to Ravello, have lunch, hang out, explore. Car to positano. Hang out on the beach, have dinner. Private car home.\n\nDay 4: capri\n- sleep in, do whatever, shop, etc in Sorrento.\n- capri night tour, departs at 3:30. Do the grottos, find a beach (which one?), have dinner and head home by 11:00. \ud83d\ude34\n-considering ischia instead of capri \ud83e\udd14\n\nDay 5:\n- no plan! Enjoy Sorrento.\n\nDay 6: back to rome\n- relax in the morning\n- somehow get to pompei/Vesuvius on our way to rome via Naples since it\u2019s on the way.\n- no plan once we get to rome, maybe visit colosseum, a museum, not sure? Do a golf cart tour? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n- dinner somewhere fun.\nStay at a hotel- haven\u2019t decided what area yet for our last night. Maybe with a view of the colosseum?\n\nDay 7: fly home\n- flight leaves at 2pm, so take it easy morning, get bf, leave for hotel around 11am\n- arrive at airport at 11:30am.

The airport is huge and we were told to allow 3 hours before departure from Rome before our flights. We needed every minute of those three hours, so don't cut it too close. Our flight out was in the early morning and we had to get a cab at 5:30 am when there is no traffic and only a half hour drive from Rome's center to the airport by the coast. You may need to leave more time on that last day if you want to make your departing afternoon flight. Also, trains in Naples area to and from Sorrento are tricky. The ticket office sold us tickets for the local train instead of the tourist train (which makes less stops). Pompeii, we were told, is vast and a short tour won't do it justice. We did Herculaneum tour instead with virtual reality glasses to see what things looked like before its population was essentially vaporized (unlike Pompeii that was buried in ash, so if you are more interested in seeing the results of being buried alive, Pompeii is your go-to). And If you are going to try to grab a pizza in Naples between disembarking from your train and getting picked up by your driver, have you thought what you will do with your luggage? I had the same dilemma and did not want to walk it to a locker a few blocks from the train station by myself while I explored for a couple of hours in Naples, so I missed out on pizza and spending time at the archeological museum there which houses many artifacts from the cities that Vesuvius destroyed. I would maybe leave a day or at least half a day to explore Naples if I get there again, which I hope to do someday. Sorrento is lovely and Franks Pizza has lines out the door and down the street if you want great pizza.
