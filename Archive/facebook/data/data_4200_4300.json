The local may have different interests and preferences than you do.\n\nI remember going to South Africa on what turned out to be the best trip of my lifetime. After going on several different big 5 safaris in different locations, touring the wine country doing wine tastings and staying in a vineyard hotel, hiking to view 4 thousand year old rock art, entering a cave containing prehistoric artifacts, visiting lots of historic sights, touring townships, swimming in the Indian Ocean and much much more someone told me I\u2019d missed the one \u201cmust see\u201d & I couldn\u2019t say I\u2019d been to South Africa because I hadn\u2019t gone shark diving. But I had absolutely zero interest in that. I had planned the perfect trip for me based on my own interests. I experienced the South Africa that I want to experience.\n\nOnly you can know what you HAVE to see. So you should plan your trip around your own interests. Know that no one can ever see anything on any one trip so design an itinerary that hits as much of what you yourself want to do as your time frame snd budget allow. In that itinerary leave a day or a few days open to allow for flexibility. Use those unplanned days for more spontaneous things like maybe day trips. Or If you don\u2019t want to take those day trip you could just spend that day making the rounds of gelato shops. Or sitting at a cafe on a busy piazza enjoying a drink while people watching.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed. Plan carefully without driving yourself crazy trying to see and do everything. Because that\u2019s impossible. Just pick your highlights and forget about the rest for now. Use your unscheduled days to be more spontaneous.\n\nDon\u2019t let yourself be overwhelmed. We all have limits, Financial, time, or physical constraints always come into play. Accepting those limits snd adjusting your trip to them is what makes for a great time. You don\u2019t want to end up not enjoying a wonderful place because you\u2019re thinking about other wonderful places that you\u2019re not going to.\n\nSo choose your activities according to what best suits your interests. Schedule your highlights. That way you won\u2019t be disappointed if something else presents itself because what you already scheduled is a must see for you. Schedule the things you\u2019d be disappointed to miss. Then be spontaneous with the time left over."}, {"username": "Laura Uribe", "comment_text": "We play everything by ear except the things that we absolutely want to see. Last Supper must be booked.
