After a 10-hour flight from the US and arriving in Rome the next day, we wanted an activity for later in the day that would be both relaxing yet keep us active so we could (hopefully) be able to sleep that evening. The tour was small group (12) and went from 5:00-9:00. We had a charming and engaging host who took us to 7 different locations to sample various Italian dishes, accompanied by a nice pour of wine, and the last stop was for delicious gelato. Our small group were folks from all over the world and we enjoyed meeting them and hearing about their Roman adventures and travel tips. Plus, it was great to explore Trastevere and find places we\u2019d like to re-visit (which we did). We also did the Skip the Line Small Group Colosseum/Forum/Palatine Hill tour, and the Sistine Pristine small group tour of the Vatican/St.Peter\u2019s Basilica/Sistine Chapel, both of which can be found on Viator or Tripadvisor, and both very well done (we lucked out with super-enthusiastic and knowledgeable guides).
