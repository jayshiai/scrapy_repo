I hope someone who lives in Italy or has lived through strikes in Italy will have the answers!\n\nI don't understand quite how they work. There are two planned strikes for when we will be in Italy. One is a rail strike that affects Italo, nation-wide. Naturally, we are scheduled to travel that day. The other is air traffic controllers, nation-wide.\n\nThe rail strike is scheduled for September 17-18, beginning at 3:00 AM on the 17th until 2:00 AM on the 18th, so 23 hours. We will be traveling at 8:30 AM on the 18th. Does this mean the trains will be backed up? How do we find out if our train will go that day at all if they are backed up?\n\nThe second strike is for what I think is air traffic controllers on September 16 from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, although I don't think this one will affect us (but not positive) as we land at 11:30 AM on September 17. In this case, do planes just not take off from or for Italy that would be landing during the time period of the strike since there is no traffic control? I'll assume it will back up traffic for a day or two?\n\nWe don't typically experience this level of strikes in the US with such regularity, so I'm not sure of how stikes like these work or affect travel, locally and nationally. BTW, there are a LOT of planned strikes for local transportation all over Italy for September. You may want to check the strike calendar, just be sure you have Google translate on so you can read it properly--put in dates that would affect you.

I can imagine how disappointed you are.\n\nBut as someone who was involved in a life threatening accident in Rome that required hospitalization\nand surgery I have to say I\u2019m glad his problem\nhappened here instead of in Italy. To be honest, I received excellent medical care there and they saved my life. But it\u2019s very frightening and psychologically\ndifficult to deal with a medical system you\u2019re unfamiliar with. And where you maybe aren\u2019t fluent with the language. (I can say some common phrases in Italian but medical terms were beyond me.). Then there\u2019s the financial aspect. Before leaving the first hospital I had to pay 24 thousand Euros for my stay of three days plus surgery. The second hospitalization\nwhich lasted two full weeks was additional. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how stressful it would have been to face those worries in a foreign country on top of concerns for your sons health.\n\nOn the bright side, as I said before, I was treated very well by the doctors and hospital staff. All of my hotels were extremely cooperative and refunded my non refundable payments in full. I hadn\u2019t expected that but was certainly happy they did it. I had purchased flight insurance which covered my missed flight back home. I was also lucky in that my home medical insurance reimbursed me in full for the amount I had to pay the Italian hospitals. And my insurance also paid for a first class flight ticket to get me home as well as paid for a nurse to accompany me.\n\nSo although you were unlucky with what happened, in another way you were lucky it happened before your trip not while you were on it.\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned from my own experience.\n1. Buy medical insurance for each trip. Most US policies do not provide for the reimbursement mine did. But you do need to have coverage while abroad.\n2. Buy flight insurance. It\u2019s cheap\nbut so important if something happens.\n3. Be sure any insurance you have provides for evacuation home.\n4. Always book directly with the provider (the airline or the hotel itself, for example) because the third party is just another layer of bureaucracy you have to deal with if something goes wrong.\n5. Stay in a fully staffed hotel not a vacation rental. The help provided by the hotel staff was invaluable to me. From going with me in an ambulance, to making arrangements to extend my husband\u2019s longer than intended stay at reduced rates, to making phone calls for us I honestly can\u2019t imagine how we\u2019d have navigated the situation without their kindness and help. They did so many things, both little and big, to help\nus out during our nightmare. I\u2019ll be forever grateful to all of them.\n6. Take along an extra high limit credit card to be used only in case of an emergency.\n\nNone of this will help you right now. But I wanted you to know you\u2019re not alone in having had a trip ruined by medical issues. I\u2019m proof that anything can happen so I hope passing on what I learned might somehow help to prevent struggles in the future.\n\nAnd of course, I hope your son is fine and healthy now.

Check into your hotel and spend the afternoon exploring the city. Visit the Palermo Cathedral, the Palace of the Normans, and the Vucciria market. In the evening, enjoy a traditional Sicilian dinner at a restaurant in the old town.\n\n**Day 2:** Take a day trip to Monreale, a town located about 15 kilometers from Palermo. Visit the Monreale Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the afternoon, take a train to Cefalu, a beautiful seaside town. Spend the rest of the day relaxing on the beach or exploring the town.\n\n**Day 3:** Take a bus to Taormina, a picturesque town located on a cliff overlooking the Ionian Sea. Spend the day exploring the town, visiting the Greek Theater, and enjoying the views. In the evening, enjoy a romantic dinner at a restaurant with a view.\n\n**Day 4:** Take a train to Catania, the capital of Sicily. Spend the day exploring the city and visiting the Cathedral of Sant'Agata. In the evening, take a flight back to the Amalfi Coast.\n\nThis is just a suggestion, of course, and you can adjust the itinerary to fit your interests and preferences. If you are interested in history and culture, you may want to spend more time in Palermo and Monreale. If you are looking for a relaxing beach vacation, you may want to spend more time in Cefalu and Taormina.

If you need additional info, please do not hesitate to ask. We flew round trip, Boston to Rome and on arrival day took a connecting flight with ITA Airways to Venice. Our itinerary was: 2 nights Venice, 3 nights Ortisei (Dolomites), 3 nights Florence, 2 nights Chianti and 4 nights Rome. 2 nights in Venice: 1. Stayed at Corte de Gabriela (lovely boutique hotel with a charming courtyard, great location, wonderful and attentive staff.) 2. Viator tour of St. Mark\u2019s and Doge\u2019s Palace \u2013 Walks of Italy - excellent tour guide. 3. Day trip to Burano using the public water taxi. Loved it. 4. Drinks at Pitti Palace right on the Grand Canal \u2013 what a treat! We loved Venice \u2013 there is a surprise waiting at every turn! Departure day: Trenitalia from Venice to Bolzano via Verona, with round trip car service from Bolzano to our Hotel. 3 nights in Ortisei \u2013 in the Western Dolomites. This is a very beautiful village, with access to spectacular hikes and stunning views. 1. Stayed at the Hotel Gardena Grodnerhof (exceptional hotel, our favorite of the trip. Customer Service really excels here! Breakfast is phenomenal; you would not believe the selection. The bar area is incredible. Delicious dinners too!) 2. Hiked the Seceda trails. 3. Hiked Alpe de Suissi. Very sad to leave! Departure day: Trenitalia from Bolzano to Firenze. Give yourselves ample time with train connections (we had 20 min). The train from Bolzano to Bologna was delayed so we missed our connection to Firenze. Scrambled to find another option. Luckily, we had downloaded the ITALO app and were able to get seats on that train as Trenitalia was sold out for the rest of the day! 3 nights in Florence: 1. Stayed at Hotel Spadai (great location and icy cold AC but for me, it fell short in other ways, just felt too boxed in. Most rooms in cities are smaller but something about the layout here and breakfast on the highest floor (with little to no ac). It was just ok for me. Hotel staff, nice. 2. Viator tour of Accademia (incl David) and climb of the Duomo Cupola was great. 3. With Passepartout, visited the Uffizi Gallery, Pitti Palace and Boboli Gardens. The latter two were ok in comparison to the Uffizi, one of the most amazing art galleries we have visited, ever. 4. Ate lunch one day at the Mercato Centrale \u2013 upstairs. Everything was so delicious. 5. Piazza della Signoria \u2013 stunning, especially at night. 6. Piazza della Republicca, love the cafes there. This is also a stunning piazza. 7. Piazzale Michelangelo \u2013 challenging walk up, but well worth the view of Firenze. 8. Ponte Vecchio \u2013 it\u2019s all jewelry stores but beautiful. Departure day: round trip car service from Firenze to Castellina in Chianti. 2 nights in Castellina in Chianti: 1. We stayed at Castello La Leccia, a gem, with breathtaking views of the countryside from this winery/agriturismo on a hill. Truly a special place and a close second to Gardena Gardenerhof. 2. Beautiful pool which we enjoyed on arrival day. 3. Private tour with Corrado di Pompeo with Tourscany. He was wonderful. His goal is to ensure that you have a great experience. With Corrado, we visited in one day: Siena (gorgeous), San Gimignano (also gorgeous with the most delicious gelato at Dondoli), and Monteriggioni (smaller and beautiful). We also visited two wineries, including Poggio Amorelli, where we had a delicious lunch and wine tasting. Departure day: Trenitalia from Florence to Rome, with car pick up at train station. 4 nights in Rome: Stayed at the Hotel Locarno \u2013 lovely, trendy boutique hotel near Piazza del Popolo. 10-minute walk to Piazza di Spagna but about 20-25 min to most other places. This was just fine for us, given that the food in Rome was spectacular! 2. Liv Tour of Vatican Museums, Sistene Chapel and St Peter\u2019s Basilica. 3. Liv Tour of Colosseum and Roman Forum. 3. Visited Fontana di Trevi, Piazza Navona, Campo de Fiori, and the Pantheon. 4. Visited the Cappuccini Crypts. 5. Visited the Borghese Gardens. 6. Visited Trastevere twice for dinner. Rome was our favorite city. It is lively and offers jaw dropping historical sites, beautiful churches, delicious food, and warm and gracious people. Admittedly, we tossed farewell coins into the Trevi Fountain, hoping to return someday soon.

If you rely on trains (which in most of Europe you should) or private car (good call far south) you will have the freedom to choose if you want to stay longer or leave sooner, if you want to skip a town on your list to hang with locals you meet in town or to go to a more unknown small village or cove where locals go.

However, if you are traveling with your twin girls aged 16, I would recommend spending one night in Bologna and two nights in Venice.\n\nHere are my reasons:\n\nBologna is a great city for food lovers. It is known as the \"Food Capital of Italy\" and is home to many 5 star and Michelin quality restaurants. Your girls will love trying all the different pasta dishes, pizzas, and gelatos.\n\nVenice is a unique city that is built on canals. It is a great place to take a gondola ride and explore the city's many bridges and narrow streets. Your girls will love getting lost in the magic of Venice.\n\nThere are more things to do in Venice for teenagers. There are many museums, art galleries, and historical sites to visit. There are also plenty of shops and cafes where your girls can spend their time.\nIf you do decide to spend an extra night in Venice, I would recommend staying in the San Marco area. This is the most central part of the city and is close to all the major attractions.\n\nI hope this helps!"}, {"username": "Mey Brouwer", "comment_text": "Sounds awesome Jacqs, when are you guys off there?

You can cross the bridge and admire the views of the Arno River, or stop to shop at one of the many jewelry stores. If you don't want to shop--visit the bridge early am before the tourists come.\n\nPonte Vecchio Florence\nExplore the Oltrarno neighborhood: This district is located on the other side of the Arno River and is a great place to find hidden gems. There are small shops, cafes, and restaurants, and it's a great place to get away from the crowds.\n\nVisit the San Lorenzo market. This market is a great place to find fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and other local products. It's a great place to experience the local culture and to do some souvenir shopping.\n\nTake a cooking class: There are many cooking classes offered in Florence, and they're a great way to learn about Italian cuisine and to try your hand at making some classic dishes. Find on airbnb experiences or getyourguide app.\n\nVisit a museum off the beaten path: There are many museums in Florence that are not as popular as the Uffizi or the Accademia.
