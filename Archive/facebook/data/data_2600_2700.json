It's very much like driving in the U.S. or Canada. (The Amalfi Coast and Sicily are a completely different story!) Make sure you know what a ZTL is. If you enter one, you will end up getting a very expensive ticket in the mail several months later. Also, speed limits are not well marked in Italy. I use Waze for that. You can set it to alert you (with a noise) that you are exceeding the speed limit. Neither Google Maps nor Waze will tell you when you are actually entering a ZTL. Someone told me that the app ZTLradar will do that, but I haven't used it and cannot vouch for it.

Not first class but the plus, premium, whatever they call them.\nThe extra room overnight is worth it.\nAlso, when you arrive keep moving! Drop your luggage and do some walking around to get acclimated. Eat an early dinner then go to bed. Helps with the jet lag.\nFinally, try to do carry on only. Luggage being lost stinks. Bring a duffel bag in your carry-on so when you make purchases you can put them in either your carry-on or your duffel. I end up checking both bags on the way back since I\u2019m going home. This is one reason I suggest Delta is for the space. A lot of European brand airlines have smaller bag requirements.\nOther than that, I suggest you build in time to relax and explore.

But Venice is a wonderful idea for the rest of your time. You'll love love it. I know it quite well now...im going back in octoner for the 4th time this year from england. Fly in to marco polo airport...from there you can go to the airport dock and jump in a water taxi ...its expensive but you will arrive like movie stars and be at your hotel in half an hour. So easy. It's about 150 euros...if you pick a hotel with its own dock the taxi can drop you right at the door. I'll recommend hotel columbina...I stayed there last November...its a nice pretty boutique hotel with a lift a/c ...its own dock ..24/7 desk ...good staff and if you pick a room facing the canal you'll be able to see the bridge of Sighs from your window. It's also 2 minutes from San marco Square... the best part of venice. From the airport you can also get a water bus that will take you to a main bus stop nearish your hotel. Or out the front of the airport you can catch a road bus to take you into venice for 10 euro......so something to suit all pockets.\nVenice is a place to absorb ...not to be rushed. Its unique. No cars ... and its small ... you can walk all of it. And you can get lost ( everyone does) ...and its fine to get lost. At night st marco Square is fabulous ... the lights... the orchestras playing. Its heaven. Just absorb all that history. The beauty of the grand canal ...the buildings!! And it's so safe ....you can wander late into the night and you won't feel uncomfortable at all. Obviously in crowded areas always make sure you keep your valuables safe ...but that's the same in any city. The station is easy to get to ...everything in venice is central ...from there you could travel to Rome...which I think is about 4 hours? Florence is closer and very pretty 2ish hours away.

From there, you can pop to Pompeii or Capri or just hang out in Sorrento town. There's nothing special to see there, but a lovely place all the same. It's one of my favourite places in Italy - been there a couple of times already and booked to go again.\n\nFrom Maiori, I think you would have to get a bus to Amalfi, where you can pick up another bus (or ferry) to take you to Sorrento.\n\nThere's a cute little train that you can take, which takes you on a tour around Sorrento, including the harbour. https://\nwww.sorrentotrai\nntour.com/en/\n\nSorrento has it's own train station, so ideal for getting you back to the airport in Naples, if you have time."}, {"username": "Starla Dawn", "comment_text": "Sorrento with a day trip to Amalfi coast, (Positano & Ravello)\nHighly recommend a private driver for the experience."}, {"username": "Donna Russonello Merlino", "comment_text": "Sorrento is great."}, {"username": "Carole Tarlap", "comment_text": "I would stay 2 days in Sorrento and the last day in Naples.

I have an iPad Air 5 with cellular option that I was going to use for data and hotspot.
