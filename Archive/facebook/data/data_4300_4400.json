I wanted a tour that would take the hassle out of the travel arrangements and to meet some like minded travellers but without being on a very rigid schedule.\nAlso, as a fellow Australian I\u2019ve had very mixed experiences with Flight Centre. Make sure that they select your seats for all of your flights at the time you book. Something our Flight Centre agent did not do.

Trafalgar, Cosmos and Insight are all great. Perhaps do a tour of Italy (smaller mileage to cover) and then have a week of your own travel once you get your bearings. 15 days to cover all those km's throughout Europe means you'll be on a bus most of the day. Italy is relatively small and each great destination is only a few hours away so you will have way more time to explore and experience.

Please be kind to me is I understand Tuscany is a region? I am not familiar with Italy so not sure if I said that right.\nI have a few questions. Here is one.. Are they any recommendations to stay in the countryside of Tuscany? Like I said please be kind and correct me where I am saying something wrong.\nThis is my rough agenda..\nFly into Rome stay for 2 days, take a train down through Naples, Pompei to Sorrento and stay for 2 days in Sorrento. Take a train to Bari and stay for 2 days. I know Bari is out the way but this is where my great grandmother is from and I would like to visit there. Then take a train up to countryside of Tuscany which I am guessing we would have to go to Florence first and drive to the countryside?

Reservations are a must, as they only allow 25 people into the chapel at a time; that's also part of the beauty of it, as you don't feel sandwiched with lots of other people. The flip side of that is that you have limited time to stay in the chapel, as there's another group waiting. If you're looking for an easy day trip from Venice, this is just the thing.

I am Italian and I can tell you how things are in many restaurant settings.\n\nFirst of all, tips are often divided among the entire staff. Many waiters and chefs are seasonal workers, so they work for 4-6 months. Hourly wages in certain places can be as low as 3-4 euros! Not everyone, but really many are underpaid and exploited 7 days a week. Therefore, in my opinion, if the service is friendly and the food is good, leave a tip!\n\nThe taxi situation is quite different. Their salary is good. While not all taxis are the same, in Italy they are notorious for taking advantage of tourists who are unfamiliar with the routes, thus significantly increasing the fare. They are also known for refusing to accept card payments and insisting on cash in order to evade taxes.\n\nIt is advisable to search on YouTube for any video related to \"taxi fare scams in Rome\" to get a better understanding of the issue. These videos can provide real-life examples of tourists being overcharged or deceived by taxi drivers.\nSo be very careful if you decide to leave a tip.\n\nEnjoy your travel! \ud83d\ude0a", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2199892273743184/", "likes": 118, "comments": [{"username": "Meghan Tan", "comment_text": "I wrote that I tip 10% at restaurants in Italy (more if service was really great!) and was lambasted.

We have to fight for decent minimum wage and humane working conditions for all and not debate about tipping which should remain a matter of choice and preference.

Forgetting to validate will get you fined. Validating machines are found all over the platforms.\n\nTickets both physical or digital may have to be scanned prior to accessing the platforms or they may be checked by station personnel at the access points leading to the platforms.\n\nCarefully check train number and not the train type or destination on the station display to know exact departure platform, delays, cancellations etc. Do not base yourself on your destination cause it may not be the final destination of the train\u2019s journey.\n\nSome stations are huge with long or far away platforms, make sure you get to your platform at least 10 mins before set time. Sometimes platforms aren\u2019t announced until very last minutes, stay close to access points so you can hurry to your platform once it\u2019s displayed.\n\nMake sure to double check coach and seat number before boarding to avoid walking the whole train and creating traffic onboard.\n\nSecure luggage on overhead racks if possible above your seat; or store your luggage in between seats in front of you so you can have them visible at all times.\n\nHead to the doors a few minutes before leaving the train especially if your destination is not the final stop.\n\nYou can follow the route through the Infomobilit\u00e0 section on the Trenitalia app Italo app or Google map to see the train stops. Normally stops are announced but you may miss it if it\u2019s dark, noisy etc.\n\nMain train companies are Trenitalia (state owned) and Italo. Trenitalia operates both local and fast trains whereas Italo operates only fast trains.\n\nThe main connecting train stations are:\n\nRoma Termini\nMilano Centrale\nBologna Centrale\nFirenze Santa Maria Novella (SMN)\nNapoli Centrale\nVenezia Santa Lucia (S. L.)\n\nThese stations all have fast trains connecting them via Italo or Trenitalia. Some parts of Italy do not have fast trains (especially coastal areas and some southern parts of the country.)\n\nAlways look for the CAPOTRENO for any info while on the train. In the stations go to info points operated by Trenitalia or if travelling with Italo, find their info points.\n\nTicketing machines for Trenitalia and Italo are different. Not all stations have operating ticket offices (only a handful in bigger train stations) so beware.\n\nHope this helps.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2199833343749077/", "likes": 4, "comments": [{"username": "Scott Perry", "comment_text": "Thanks!"}, {"username": "Mbell Arteaga", "comment_text": "We will be traveling between cities and taking trenitalia.

Must say waking up in the middle of the night in your own house is confusing after being away for three weeks and staying in eight different places.\n\nI have received many requests for full details of our trip and once I get caught up on work stuff I will put a post together. But as I know people are actively planning their own trips will share some details of our itinerary and accommodation happy to answer any questions as this group was a great resource for my planning.\n\nDays 1-4: Florence in large three bedroom apartment (can be booked as AirBnB but I booked with Apartments Florence), tons of stairs but the location by Mercato Centrale and the two rooftop decks made it worth it.\n\nVan with driver from Florence to Vernazza with stops in Siena (1 hr), San Gimignano (2 hrs - grabbed lunch) and Pisa (1 hr) was well worth the money. Our driver was great like having someone uncle or poppi drive you around.\n\nDays 4-7: Stayed in Vernazza which after visiting all five towns in Cinque Terre was 100% our favourite. We explored all towns by foot and train. We LOVED Carattino 12 where we stayed that we have booked with Cinque Terre Vacation. Ruth was by far the most amazing host I have ever dealt with and the apartment was amazing. On our final night there booked a five hour sunset cruise with hellocinqueterre which was the highlight of our weekend there. They are based out of Manarola and were amazing. Seeing the towns from the water was amazing and you could even arrange to visit a few or stop for swimming if your time allows.\n\nTrain from Vernazza to La Specia and connecting train to Rome.\n\nDays 7-11: Rome (yes this was a lot of time but we knew it was going to be the hottest part of our trip and we were planning on going back to our apartment in the afternoon every day which we did). As we were there for more days we were not rushed at all which was great as it game us a chance to relax and enjoy the city and all it had to offer. We stayed in a massive four bedroom apartment that was located in Ponte which we thought was a great location.\n\nCaught train from Rome to Naples and changed to the Campania Express to continue our travel to Sorrento (the journey on the Campania Express was one of the only crappy parts of our entire trip, wish we had just booked a van)\n\nDays 11-13: Sorrento we booked Raffaele\u2019s place through AirBnB. Was a strange place in the end as it was four bedroom units with ensuites off of a main corridor. Would be great for couples or people traveling together that want their own space but for a family was weird. It was centrally located and clean. The area was a bit loud at night but got the sense that a lot of Sorrento is loud at night on a weekend. Fun town though. On the Sunday (day 12) we were picked up by a driver to head back up to Pompeii and Herculaneum for a private tour that I had arranged. The guide Ludovica from Ludviguida was just amazing, we had originally found her though Tours with Locals but easier to book her directly through her Instagram or website. Driver took us back to Sorrento after the tours.\n\nDays 13-16: Capri and Amalfi Coast we were on Capasecca for this time and it was amazing and super memorable. Pretty big splurge but do not regret it for one second. Being on a boat avoided traffic and allowed us to be in Capri and Amalfi after the day trippers had left which is a completely different experience. The girls all loved Capri so next time we will likely stay there for a few nights and arrange day trips by chartering a boat to visit other towns if we want.\n\nDays 16-17: Booked van with driver drive us to Naples for the night. Had just planned on late dinner and sleeping there but aftr having met Ludovica we arranged last minute to have a tour of her beloved home city Naples the morning before we left. We did a two hour tour with her and only wish we had had more time but will be back.\n\nTrain from Naples to Bologna and then out to Parma.\n\nDays 17-19: Parma we just stayed at the Novotel as there were very limited options when we booked as it was late change to our itinerary to go to the Harry Styles final concert of his world tour. The hotel staff was great, hotel was clean and we got one of the few adjoining rooms which made us happy (when were were told the room numbers were 322 and 329 by front desk we were not expecting them to be adjoining). We didn\u2019t really get a chance to explore the town or area but did squeeze in a tour of a cheese factory which was fun and cool to see.\n\nDays 19-20: Train back to Florence via Bologna. This was the only missed train connection of our trip. Had booked a hotel for our final night just because meeting someone for keys for one night seemed like dumb idea. In the end it was the most amazing finally night we could have hoped for with an absurd room upgrade. The hotel had a small outdoor pool in a garden setting and staff were great. We will definitely stay that next time we are in Florence.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2199779387087806/", "likes": 75, "comments": [{"username": "Monique Gomez", "comment_text": "Can you send links for Florence apt and Rome apt?
