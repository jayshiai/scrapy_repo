Also if something should occur, they can help you handle it.\nOnce you understand how the trains and buses operate, how to buy tickets, what areas to avoid etc.; you may be ready for solo travel without guides.\nMy first trip to Europe was done at age 40. We rented a car and followed our noses from Zurich thru northern Italy and then back through the Dolomites, Austria and flew out of Munich. I did much of the driving which meant I didn\u2019t see as much as we moved about. It was like being an adult child because you didn\u2019t understand a lot.\nI understand Italian so the Italian portion of the trip was easier but customs are different. There are often no words in another language for common English words. For example, there is no way to easily find overnight parking in Italy.

So much free time and getting lost you find some of the best places. We drove to Pisa and then Lucca and on the way was this fabulous pasticceria with so many beautiful cakes, pastries and Gelato. We visited the amazing hilltop village of Todi. Places we would have never found without a car."}, {"username": "Barbara Bastianini", "comment_text": "We\u2019ve driven the length and breadth of Italy more times than I can count. honestly it\u2019s our preferred way to travel. The trains are fine for going from big city to big city but if you\u2019re interested in going from small town to small town the car is far superior. It\u2019s also great for spontaneity and flexibility. If you see something interesting along the way you can stop to visit it.\n\nCost wise. That depends on a lot of things. First the total cost of train travel is multiplied by the number of people in your group because each person will have to buy a ticket. But with car travel the total cost will be divided by the number of people so the per person transportation cost can be less. With 2, 3 or 4 people we\u2019ve often found the car to be less expensive. For one person the train is usually cheaper. You pretty much have to price each trip out both ways to determine which is in your financial\nInterest. Last, renting from the airport tends to be more expensive than renting from a downtown location. And because certain train routes cost more than others your specific itinerary and destinations make generalizations\ndifficult. You have a lot of things to price out!!\n\nThe trick is to accurately calculate the actual total cost. With a car you have to include the cost of the rental itself, insurance, gas, tolls, and parking fees. With the train you have to include the cost of a taxi between your lodging & the train station every time you arrive and leave a location. Those are the total costs to compare before making a decision.\n\nWhen renting be aware that most European rental cars are manuals. If you require an automatic the price will increase and you\u2019ll have to reserve well in advance because the supply is limited. Also be aware that returning the car to a different location than where you picked it up will increase your cost, sometimes significantly.\n\nLots of people will try to discourage you from driving. Yes it can be a challenge at times and the Italians generally drive aggressively. If you yourself are afraid to drive there that would be a good reason not to. But I wouldn\u2019t let the fears of others convince me not to drive. Most of us have enough fears to worry about without borrowing those of others. I\u2019d suggest you talk to people who have actually driven in Italy rather than people who haven\u2019t.\n\nResearch the Limited transportation zones and know the road sign for that. Those are zones in cities that only locals can drive\nIn. (This is to lessen traffic congestion, to allow pedestrians to safely use the streets and sidewalks and to prevent car exhaust from harming ancient buildings.) license plate numbers belonging to each zone are registered. Cameras are set up at intersections to take photos of cars entering the zones. Those entering with license plates not registered will be fined. The camera takes great photos of both the plate and the driver so it\u2019s hard to dispute the fine. The zones are always marked and always marked in such a way that you can make a turn to avoid entering the xone. The problem is many tourists don\u2019t see the signs or are too nervous about driving to turn. Some poor souls drive in and out of limited zones multiple times and are fined for each and every infraction. It takes a while for the driver to be traced through the license plate and the car rental agency so the driver might not receive notice of the fine until months after the trip. And the amount can be significant depending on how many times a zone was entered. So it\u2019s important to Google that sign so you\u2019ll recognize it.\n\nOtherwise big city driving is pretty much like big city driving everywhere else. Country roads are country roads everywhere and highways are highways . But small villages laid out before the invention of cars were designed for walkers. They might take a bit of getting used to.\n\nBut truthfully self driving can be a very rewarding way to explore Italy."}]}, {"id": "2193579831041095", "text": "", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2193579831041095/", "likes": 65, "comments": [{"username": "Frank Waegeman", "comment_text": "Talking whit there hands"}, {"username": "MarkandJu Johnson", "comment_text": "Drive up your ass"}, {"username": "Charles Jones", "comment_text": "Eat dinner for like 5 hours!"}, {"username": "\u0421\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 \ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c"}, {"username": "Rachel Michelle", "comment_text": "Mind their own business"}, {"username": "Leonardo Solorzano", "comment_text": "Defend all the game \u26bd\ufe0f"}, {"username": "Carolina Alejandro Clabaugh", "comment_text": "Always dress nice."}, {"username": "Giovanni Locatelli", "comment_text": "Live well."}, {"username": "Mary Whitler", "comment_text": "Drink aperol spritz in place of iced tea"}, {"username": "Gerry Hamilton", "comment_text": "No pineapple on pizza"}, {"username": "Rip Lonergan", "comment_text": "Live, laugh and love"}, {"username": "Carina Chesson", "comment_text": "Have a Nana Nap \ud83d\ude34 mid afternoon \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"}, {"username": "Linda Jane Richardson", "comment_text": "Have long meals with family, dressed in their best and don\u2019t get drunk"}, {"username": "Ulla Liukkonen", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb"}, {"username": "Kate Farrell", "comment_text": "Always very well groomed, especially the young men!
