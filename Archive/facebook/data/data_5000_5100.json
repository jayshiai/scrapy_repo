Your posts have been extremely helpful to us this past year in planning our 2-week trip, so i wanted to return the favor. These were our experiences, which I hope you find helpful. It\u2019s really long and detailed, so please excuse the length.\nMy wife teaches, so we can only go away in July. Because we knew it would be hot, we purposely looked for hotels with A/C and private bathrooms in each room. That was non-negotiable.\nIn Rome we stayed at the Napoleon. It was a very nice and reasonable place, with great staff and a decent breakfast. None of the major attractions are nearby, but there\u2019s a Metro stop right outside the door. We didn\u2019t use it\u2014we only traveled by taxi that we called for on the FreeNow app (which was terrific, until it wasn\u2019t\u2014sometimes they can\u2019t find an available car.) When that happened, we switched to Uber (working with ItTaxi) or walked a bit to a different location and tried again.\nBe ready to use more euros than you think, mostly for tips, water and snacks. We brought $300 in Euros. We barely made it out even.\nThe first night we ate at Felice a Testacccio, because of recommendations we found in this group. It was super. The cacio e pepe and ravioli were extremely fresh and tasty. We made reservations, but they weren\u2019t necessary at 7:00pm when the restaurant opened.\nWe then took a Rome by Night tour, which was a fun way to start the trip. We had a great guide, and learned a lot of interesting stories we wouldn\u2019t have heard on any other tour about the \u201cdark side\u201d of Rome. It was their version of a \u201cghosts and mystery\u201d tour.\nThe next morning we did the Rome in a Day tour, a 7-hour tour in 98 degree heat. Several people left the group during the tour because of the heat, although our outstanding tour guide, Karolina, did her best to always find us shady spots to stop. We started at the Vatican and saw all the major attractions, with \u201cskip the line\u201d tickets\u2014a must-have, especially in this heat. Karolina couldn\u2019t have been any better, and it was well-worth the 5.5 total miles walked in this heat. Although some really struggled with the heat, I\u2019m 63 with a heart condition and I did just fine. Hat, plenty of water (or Gatorade/electrolytes) and a bandana to wipe my face and neck were key. The one thing I really wish I brought with me were Crystal Light packets. The only cold drink you\u2019ll find in Italy with no sugar (other than water) is Coke Zero. I don\u2019t drink Gatorade either, but I wish I had some powdered mix for my water bottles. We did buy collapsible water bottles through Amazon. They worked fine. Public water is plentiful in Rome\u2014much less so elsewhere\u2014but keep in mind that once it goes into a non-insulated bottle in 98 degree temps, it gets warm quickly (it\u2019s not all that cold to begin with). So I think a small Hydroflask or insulated bottle is best. And when buying drinks in caf\u00e9s and restaurants, remember to ask for a glass with ice. Otherwise you may not get one.\nTo set the record straight, I\u2019d say at least 30% of the visitors in the Sistine Chapel were in shorts or dresses that didn\u2019t cover their knees. We saw no one turned away. So yes, covering knees and shoulders is a sign of respect and is demanded on signage inside the Vatican, but in 98 degree heat no one seemed to worry about it. And yet the next day I stopped into the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, wearing shorts and a t-shirt (same as many of the men). Ten minutes after entering, I witnessed an usher telling two different women wearing shorts that they needed to cover their knees, and he had something they could throw over them. No acknowledgement whatsoever of me or the other men in shorts.\nThe Trevi Fountain was magnificent, but I was surprised at how little open space there was around it. Lots of shops and restaurants within coin-tossing distance. And I saw the little rooftop cafe that one of you posted about, which looks right down to the fountain area. Based on what I\u2019ve read here in the past, I expected 1000 people waiting to toss their coins. There were maybe a couple hundred tops. Easy in and out.\nThe Roman Forum is massive and impressive\u2014my favorite part of the tour. But also the place with the least amount of shade.\nThe Coliseum was fun to see, but by that point we were wiped.\nDinner at Mimi e Coco Trast was very good\u2014not quite as great as Felice. The starters were outstanding, and we shared an entree that was good. They have several different versions of \u201cspritzes\u201d\u2014worth trying. The host convinced us to split a tiramisu, which was okay, and she then brought us two complimentary limoncellos. The limoncello in Italy isn\u2019t as thick and sweet as what we buy in the states.\nAll gelato is good gelato, especially when you\u2019re in Italy. Venchi has the best.\nThe pizza here is also amazing, regardless of the thickness of the crust.\nGo into any and every basilica you pass, regardless of its outward simplicity. You\u2019ll be astounded by the beauty and magnificence when you enter.\nTrain to Florence cancelled thanks to Trenatalia union strike. Spent waaaay too much time in the customer service area trying to determine options before deciding to just rent a car and drive to Florence. Cost an extra $250 including gas and insurance (always buy the insurance driving in Europe!). But we got there. Food and gelato are great everywhere\u2014pizza still outstanding. Hotel Paris is in a terrific location, but that\u2019s the extent of the praise for it.\nHotel Napoleon in Rome was an 8, losing its two points only for location. This hotel in Florence gets a 10 for location and not much for anything else. Small, old rooms, no ironing board or iron for us to use (as if I\u2019m not wrinkled enough), and a spider crawled along the bed while we sat there. There are a bunch of hotels right in Piazza Santa Maria Novella that look much nicer.\nDinner at I\u2019Raddi, based on a friend\u2019s recommendation. $53 for the two of us, which included a bottle of wine. I spend $14 for a glass at our favorite Italian restaurant back home.\nSkip the line tickets for the Uffizi\u2014not sure we needed to spend the extra money because I only saw 20-30 people in line. Lots to see in the Uffizi\u2026we spent about two hours there (so, so hot, even though it\u2019s air conditioned).\nWalked the streets and piazzas. Didn\u2019t go into Il Duomo. Had dinner right next to it at Le Botteghe di Donatello. Good bistecca (if you like eating raw meat), and my wife\u2019s pizza was as good as all the others. Serenaded throughout dinner by a violinist and clarinetist playing in the piazza.\nYou have to get to Venchi for chocolate and/or gelato (we got both and they were super). As we sat outside the store eating, a man turned on his iPhone and speaker and began singing incredible opera music. Amazing.\nOh, and we got scammed out of only $5. A man came up and asked if we were from the states. I tried to ignore him but he engaged my wife. He gave her two little figurines and 3 bracelets for our children. He then handed me two leather belts, which I tried to refuse. He showed us a photo of his (or someone\u2019s!) one year old twins, and asked for money. I handed him $5, and he asked for $10 saying he gave me two leather belts (that were rolled up so I don\u2019t even know if they had holes in them). I said no, and gave him the belts back. So we walked away with two little figurines and 3 bracelets. He walked away with $5. Then I had gelato.\nThe next day, we had skip the line tickets for the Accademia. It was well worth both the time and the extra money. Fascinating exhibit, and Il David is magnificent. We found a caf\u00e9 for iced coffee right outside, which made my wife happy. After roaming a bit through the central market area and seeing tent after tent of the same exact things \u2013 leather bags, belts, and T-shirts, we had lunch at a cafe in Santa Maria Novella. So many of you have said don\u2019t eat right in the piazzas, but the pizza was good, and we were under a canopy with a cool mist spraying on us. A worthwhile stop. During the height of the afternoon heat\u2014only 93\u00b0 today so a little cooler than it has been\u2014I used that time to do laundry. A total of 8 euros to wash and dry at a local laundromat. Pretty easy. Having 30 minutes in between each cycle also gave me another opportunity to roam around and explore Firenze.\nDuring those two cycles, the temp rose to 96 again. So hot I actually drank a Powerade, which I never do.\nDinner at La Giostra that night, based solely on Facebook recommendations from these blogs. Thank you for that! Great place, excellent food, slow service. They did add a cover charge of $3pp, which many places have done, but they also put on the bill \u201cGratuity not Included,\u201d which I thought was strange. I gave them way more than they deserved, but the food was still worth it.\nGelato at Venchi again, because we can. Same opera singer was out crooning, so another great night.\nNever an issue with pickpockets or feeling unsafe\u2014anywhere in Italy. As a matter of fact, I never used my fanny pack. I carried any cash and credit cards in one front pocket of my shorts, and my phone in the other. Never needed my passport or even a copy. Anywhere but when traveling.\nMade it to Venice easily on the train\u2014no problems in either station. It\u2019s nice when there\u2019s no strike! Took a way-too crowded vaporetto to Piazza San Marco, and walked only 400 feet to our hotel, the Campiello (very nice).\nTurned right around and did a glass factory tour and demonstration in Murano\u2014no big deal and their goal is to get you to buy thousands of dollars in glass. We caught the next boat back after the demonstration.\nHad dinner right by the water. For those of you who keep warning others about \u201ctourist trap\u201d restaurants, here\u2019s my take. These places may be $3 more per person for meals, but the food is still better than anything we have in the states, and sitting under a tent in 95 degree weather with a bit of a sea breeze makes it well worth it. For every meal we\u2019ve had on a back street somewhere, we\u2019ve had one under a tent with a beautiful setting. I\u2019ll gladly take them both.\nNext was the Venice in a Day tour. BTW, we used Viator for everything and didn\u2019t have a single issue.\nWe also walked a LOT at night\u2014Venice is alive! No issues, and a lot was open later in the evening (11:00ish\u2014which is late for us!)\nEasy transport to the airport in Venice via Alilaguna. We weren\u2019t flying out, but renting a car to drive to Lucca. That turned into a horror show, because renting through Expedia got us a car through Ecovia. The only problem is you show up at the rental car offices at the airport, and Ecovia doesn\u2019t exist on the signs (they\u2019re at the Autovia booth), so it took me an hour to just find them. I\u2019m amazed at how few people at the airport spoke English and tried to be helpful! Not many!\nBy the time I found them, the agent told me my car rental was cancelled because I showed up more than two hours after my flight landed. That\u2019s because we flew in 9 days ago! Our rental agreement was from July 18-22, but they saw we flew in on the 10th and assumed we didn\u2019t pick it up. Expedia has no phone number, so all you can do is chat with an agent online, which wasn\u2019t all that helpful and took forever. I finally went to the Budget counter and got a car. Lesson to be learned\u2014rent from the companies you know!\nStopped in Verona along the way (my wife teaches a lesson in Romeo & Juliet), and that was very, very nice. Great lunch and a nice walk through the town to Juliet\u2019s house.\nMade it to Lucca in our rental\u2026nice ride through the countryside. Btw, drivers in Italy (not sure if they\u2019re locals or tourists) don\u2019t believe in using turn signals. They drive up right behind you close enough to peek in your back seat, flash their high beams, then zip by you and cut you off. They also like to drive along the center line until they decide which lane they\u2019d ultimately like to be in. So frustrating!\nI love Lucca! The Hotel Ilaria is amazing, and we had a fabulous dinner tonight at Canuleia.\nBtw, I did one full load of laundry after about 5 days (Firenze), then washed other things in sinks as necessary. That lasted me two weeks with a carry on.\nIt seems like everyone in the country smokes cigarettes, even in this heat. It\u2019s particularly bothersome sitting outside to dine, and having someone light up next to you while you\u2019re trying to enjoy your meal.\nWoke up and rode a bike along the outer wall of Lucca\u2014great experience! The hotel offered bikes for free (along with snacks and drinks through the day\u2014love the Hotel Ilaria!)\nBest experience of the trip\u2014a Cesarane cooking class through Viator. It was just my wife, a young woman who came by herself, and me at the home of an incredibly nice local woman. She taught us how to make tagliatelle, gnocchi and tiramisu. All three were fantastic (he says modestly). She also provided a great wine, good stories, and an explanation of how and why we make pasta certain ways. Loved it, and we invited her to visit us on her next trip to Boston.\nThe next day, we had another amazing experience. Drove to San Gimignano and did a winery tour at Fattoria Il Piano. Two and a half hours, between the guided tour and the tasting of FIVE wines, plus some really good food. So worth the 90 minute drive each way.\nWe walked along the wall today\u2014so beautiful and relaxing. Did some shopping (great stuff!), then went to the Puccini concert, which they do nightly in a gorgeous church. Amazing opera singers and pianist! Such a good decision. Finished it off with a very nice meal in the Anfiteatro Romano.\nFinal full day, drove from Lucca to Rome. Checked into an airport hotel, the Riviera. It was awful! It was near the beach\u2014which was in a seedy area. Might explain why the room smelled like dead octopus. A long, dark hair greeted us in the sink. We checked out right away\u2014lost our money because we prepaid\u2014and got a room at the Airport Hilton. We made up for it by going into Trastavere and eating at Felice a Testaccio again\u2014ending our trip the way we began. We then walked 1.5 miles (needed the walk!) to Venchi for one, final, awesome gelato. Venchi has the best in any city you find one!\nOne final thought.

If you drive there, consider parking far from the tower, as near it there are two parking very expensive and usually crowded and you\u2019ll easily get a fine ending in forbidden roads. Lungarno Buozzi is good road to park or in parcheggio Paparelli (not on wednesday or saturday, the parking becomes a market).\nWhen you arrive in Pisa train station consider 20 minutes walk to the tower BUT when setting google maps put two middle stops or you will find yourself walking the shortest road (by 3 minutes) but miss all the good spots.\nSo at first walk towards the Keith Haring mural (the largest in the world), then to Borgo Stretto (a porched road with some nice shops, easier with the sun), then to Piazza dei Cavalieri (where a beautiful Vasari palace is, now a University, and a Church that, when it is open, has original flags from the Crusades ) and at that point go to the Tower. It will be a much more pleasant walk.\nWhen visiting the Tower visit also the Cathedral, the Baptistry and the Cemetery, they are stunning and worth a visit (there is also a great museum, Museo dell'opera del Duomo, maybe you don't want to overdo, but you can go there to grab a coffee in its bar which has a stunning view on the tower).\nNear the tower Grand Hotel Duomo has a great terrace on the roof where you can have a drink or dinner at sunset with a beautiful view.\nClearly there are other really good things to see: near the tower there is the first university botanical garden in the world, not far a stunning little medieval museum called Museo di San Matteo, the Museo delle navi Antiche, the only museum in the world with original roman vessels in display\u2026 it all depends on how much time you have!\nTo eat: you must run away from everything near the tower, you can go to Osteria dei Cavalieri for really good traditional tuscan, Pomodoro e Mozzarella for a really good pizza, Osteria di piazza for simple traditional tuscan in a nice little square with only a few dishes every day. If your don't want to sit but just grab something on the go look for Pizzeria Montino and taste a chickpeas sort of flat bread called cecina and a pizza quarter. Around thees places there are many little restaurants where almost only Italians go.\nIce-cream, one of the best rated in Italy: De Coltelli!\nIf, by chance, your are there for the evening go long the river, it's an University town, so lots of bars and students having fun!\nPhotos of my friend Carlo Cafferini, a stunning photographer, of the San Rossore Park, just outside Pisa, and of some buildings!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2190794237986321/", "likes": 51, "comments": [{"username": "Paulinha C\u00e3", "comment_text": "Thanks a lot for all information.

However, if your husband really dislikes crowds, I would say Santa Maria Maggiore, San Giovanni in Laterano or San Paolo Fuori le Mura are also very impressive Basiliche.

I am hoping to find someone who has flown Air France recently and can advise me regarding their carry on rules. I know the size of the carry on and they state they\u0906\u0923\u0916\u0940 allow: 21.7\u201d l x 13.8\u201d w x 9.9\u201d h (55 x 35 x 25 cm) including wheels and handles. I am seriously stressing out trying to find a soft side carry on that small, the smaller ones are so small they fit under the seat! Most in the stores are 23\" tall with wheels, at least. Hard sides are smaller but we do not want to purchase a hard sided carry on.\n\nMy question is how strict is AF when it comes to the carry on size? I'm about ready to buy one and take it the Atlanta airport and try to fit it in their sizing template they have at the baggage check. Delta and other carriers allow taller sizes than Air France.\n\nAny Air France flyers who've flown from the states to Italy who can advise me as to how you handled the carry on sizing?

I have learned over the years I overpack & end up bringing back at least a third of my clothes unworn. I also don\u2019t worry so much about difft purses or shoes, but instead I change up my look with jewelry (not the expensive stuff) & that doesn\u2019t take up much space. But it\u2019s your trip, so you have to do what you like. Main thing is comfort. You can hand wash & also take a travel size of febreeze \ud83d\ude2c. You can also take some older clothes that you either toss or donate & that frees up space for bringing back souvenirs. I\u2019ve learned to take less over the years, but still can improve myself.

Some of the beaches in Trapani are sandy, such as Spiaggia di San Giuliano and Spiaggia delle Mura di Tramontana. Others, such as Cala Rossa and Cala dei Turchi, are more rocky.\n\nIf you are planning on swimming in the sea, it is a good idea to bring water shoes, even if the beach is sandy. This is because the seabed can be rocky in some areas, and water shoes will help to protect your feet.\n\nThere are cabanas to change into bathing suits and showers at some of the beaches in Trapani. However, it is a good idea to check in advance, as not all beaches have these facilities.\n\nHere are some of the good beaches close to Trapani:\n\n* **Spiaggia di San Giuliano:** This is a long, sandy beach with clear blue water. It is a popular beach for families, and there are plenty of facilities, such as cabanas, showers, and restaurants.\n\n* **Spiaggia delle Mura di Tramontana:** This is a smaller beach, but it is just as beautiful as Spiaggia di San Giuliano. The sand is a little more coarse, but the water is just as clear. There are also a few cabanas and showers on this beach.\n\n* **Cala Rossa:** This is a small, secluded beach with clear turquoise water. It is located in a nature reserve, so it is a great place to go for a swim and relax in the sun.\n\n* **Cala dei Turchi:** This is a beautiful beach with white sand and clear blue water. It is located in a cove, so it is a great place to go for a swim and escape the crowds.\n\nHere are some other suggestions for things to do in Trapani:\n\n* Visit the **Trapani salt pans:** The Trapani salt pans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They are a beautiful place to visit, and you can learn about how salt is made.\n\n* Explore the **Erice Castle:** Erice Castle is a medieval castle that is perched on a hilltop overlooking Trapani. It is a great place to visit for stunning views of the city and the sea.\n\n* Take a boat trip to **Egadi Islands:** The Egadi Islands are a group of islands off the coast of Trapani. They are a great place to go for swimming, snorkeling, and hiking.\n\n* Visit the **Mazara del Vallo Cathedral:** Mazara del Vallo Cathedral is a beautiful cathedral that is located in Mazara del Vallo, a town about 30 kilometers from Trapani.\nPs, my favorite places in Sicily are Taormina, Corleone and the Mafia museum and the small village where Cinema Paradiso was filmed, whose name I forget.
