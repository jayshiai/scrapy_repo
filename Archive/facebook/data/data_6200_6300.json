Good luck and enjoy your travels.\nThere\u2019s the obvious things to do like wear a hat, sunscreen, which should be applied at least 30 mins or more before you go out so it has time to sink into your skin, if I don\u2019t do this I find it just makes my face sweat more and runs into my eyes. It can sting. So apply early.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about your bare arms, who cares, it\u2019s too hot, I\u2019m 65 and my arms show their age but in the heat I won\u2019t wear a sleeve, t shirts etc because they make you feel hotter.

Until recently, it was a hidden gem known only to locals, but now, a few tourists have started discovering this place, leading them to expand the restaurant a bit. The signature red sauce pasta they serve is unlike anything I've ever tried before; it's ridiculously good. To reach this place, you have to walk through Oltrarno, which allows you to experience the local life more intimately as it's a bit less touristy. Just make sure to book in advance, as it's almost impossible to get a table otherwise. Another fantastic option (a bit more upscale) is Cantinetta Antinori, offering traditional Tuscan food with excellent cuisine and charming decor.\n\nFor lunch, I usually frequent either the mozzarella bar OBICA or Fishing lab. If you're a fan of fish, Fishing lab is also a great choice. Don't miss the stunning frescoes on the second floor! For a quick snack, the must-try is the tiny truffle panini with prosecco at Procacci. While it was recently purchased by new owners and might not be as amazing as it used to be, it still holds a special place in the hearts of Florentines.\n\nAdditionally, I absolutely love the restaurant at Hotel Calimala, and that's saying something because I usually don't like hotel restaurants. I believe this one is related to the famous Israeli chef Ottolenghi, which might explain why the food is exceptionally good. Their brunch is fantastic, and the Angel rooftop bar is a well-kept secret gem in Florence. :)))"}, {"username": "Ana Ka", "comment_text": "Oh, and if you go to Montepulciano, I really loved the tour by appy guide tours.
