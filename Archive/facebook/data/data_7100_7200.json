Glad did not bring\n- hair straightener. I should have left home. I used once for going to dinner but it was hot and I have long hair so I wore it up all the time.\n- off botanicals bug wipes. Brought a few and needed in anacapri and hike in Amalfi.\n- my regular crossbody I use at home was great.\n- so glad we brought cooling towels and a mini fan (I need air on me at night).\n\nApps:\nI had the Omni app, Trenitalia, Italo, Ferryhopper and freenow. Used all. Used Omni to see best train times and booked train directly on the one we were using. Freenow was how we got taxi in Rome and it was great. No surprises and can pay on app just like Uber.\nHappy to answer questions.
