When you are shopping and spend more than 155 in one store the same day, if the store is affiliated with a tax refund company, you can gen a refund at the airport when you leave for about 15-17% of the amount that you spend.

You are on a coach bus with about 32 people total. The first stop is Cassini which is about an hour and a half from Rome, for a 15 minute pit stop.\n- Next stop is Pompeii, which is about 1 hr 30 min from Cassino, depending on traffic. Once there, you meet up with a separate tour guide that will walk you through the ruins, this was about 1.5 hr tour (did not cover ALL of pompeii). We had lunch at a restaurant in Pompeii but we opted to take our food on the bus so we could buy some souvenirs just outside the archaeological site as you do not have time before or after to browse.\n- Next stop is Positano, which took us about an hour to get to because of traffic. When you\u2019re about 3/4 of the way there you switch over to a van since the roads are even narrower in Positano. We spent about an hour and 45 minutes there including the walk to and from where they parked the van. That gave us some time to dip our feet in the sea and do some shopping.\n- After that we had a 2.5 ish hour drive back to the first pit stop for a break, about 20-25 minutes. Then, we rode the rest of the way back to Rome, about 1-1.5 hr.\n- It was a LONG day but it was worth it as we have limited time in Italy. In total it was about a 13 ish hour day from pickup to drop off. My husband would have liked to stay in Pompeii to explore more but that wasn\u2019t an option \ud83e\udd23\nHope this helps!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2212321225833622/", "likes": 49, "comments": [{"username": "Gina Christopher", "comment_text": "We are doing this as well, but a private tour for $220 pp. I can't wait!

There is a ticket office in the arrivals area, and a ticket machine at the bus stop right outside the terminal. Buses run every 15 minutes and the ride to the Piazzale Roma bus terminal takes about 25 minutes.\n\nThere are also coaches operated by another company (ATVO), which run every 30 minutes and are marginally faster. The tickets cost the same, but they are not interchangeable\nwith the urban bus tickets. I\u2019m pointing this out because I\u2019ve frequently seen tourists get on the wrong bus and get fined for not having a valid ticket. It\u2019s easy to tell them apart, however: ACTV operates white urban buses, ATVO operates blue long-distance coaches.\n\nFor a more scenic ride into town, take the Alilaguna waterbus. Tickets are 15\u20ac one way, 27\u20ac return, and are sold at the ticket office in the arrivals hall. Take the moving walkway on the first floor to reach the docks. It\u2019s a slower ride, but arguably quite unique, and it has the advantage of stopping at various points of the city including St. Mark\u2019s.\n\nThe fastest and most expensive option is the water taxi, which typically costs 135\u20ac for up to four people (with an additional 10\u20ac for every additional person, up to a maximum of 10 people).
