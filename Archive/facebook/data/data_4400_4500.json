We had only a couple of hours to explore, but we wish we could have spent the rest of the day!

We loved strolling through the streets filled with flowers, vines and pretty shops, it looked like it came straight out of a storybook! Then we came across a stunning cathedral that took our breath away! It was covered with ornate, colorful carvings that shone in the sunlight. We did not want to leave this place!

Either the bottom level, cheapest places where most people do not want to stay or the highest priced luxury ones that most people can\u2019t afford could be your only options.

We flew non-stop Miami-Zurich. Visited family and then flew ITA Zurich to Rome.\n\nROME\nWe arrived from Switzerland, a Schengen country, so for anyone wondering, there is no need to go through passport control once in the Schengen region. We traveled this leg of the trip COO and personal bag.\n\nWe had a private transfer prebooked for 60 Euros which took us from FCO to the hotel in the area of the Pantheon.\n\nWeather-hot, but manageable. The first few days in Rome were delightful. Last day got into the 90s but only 28% humidity, so this FL girl was fine. Clocked on average 20-21K steps daily.\n\nRoma is busy, crowded, dusty and WONDERFUL!!\n\n-Vatican (early admission with breakfast). Booked directly through the official website. By 7:30, the lines were long including the skip-the-line line, which moves fairly fast once the third party tours go in. If you book directly, there is a separate line with no wait, as they let you in up to 15 minutes prior to the timed ticket. There is another line inside to exchange your voucher for actual tickets. That moved fairly fast.\n\n-Saint Peter's Basilica- the lines are long to get in. If you go to the Vatican Museum you can go in after the Sistine Chapel. We didn't, (my mom was done walking at that point :) )so we decided to go the next morning. No lines early. By the time we left the lines were incredibly long (although they move fairly fast). We had the Basilica almost to ourselves for a while. Within a couple of hours, everyone was on top of each other. While there, visited the Grotto.\nI attempted to get tickets to the Scavi ahead of the trip by wasn't able to secure them within the time we had available -one excuse to go back.\n\nWhen visiting the Basilica, make sure you have tops that cover your shoulders and your dress is below the knees. I wore long wide-legs pants and short sleeves to make it easy. (otherwise you have to drape the blue cover over you! not fun in a hot day)\n\n-Trevi. We visited it a few times (since we were so close to it). It was busy, but plenty of room for photo ops. Everyone, except the instragram divas, was very polite and accommodating and moved out of the way to let others have their pictures.\n\n-Pantheon. Get tickets ahead of time. You will still wait in line, but only with the people with tickets for that hour (they are 1 hr time slots ie. 10-11, 2-3, etc, not timed exactly). The lines for tickets were long. One for cash, one for CCs. They wrapped around, even at 9AM. We had tickets for the first hour they opened.\n\n-Golf Cart tour. We booked through Rolling Rome. Eduardo was AMAZING! we had seen some of the attractions so I asked him to take us to his favorite places in Rome. He obliged, including his favorite gelato place. Oh my! don't miss Neve di Latte! Amazing. It was a private tour, so we had the freedom to go places away from the typical route.\n\n-Colosseum. We had booked an underground/arena tour through LivTours. The underground portion was cancelled a few weeks before we left, so they rebooked us in a semi-private tour that included everything else. Our guide was magnificent. We had a blast and he even explained portions of what we could see of the underground. There was only one other family with us with two young boys and he was very attentive to them and really took the time with them and my mom (83 y/o). I cannot imagine doing the Colosseum in a large group. If you can, go for private or semi-private tours.... or try to get tickets directly from Coopculture.it.\nBTW, it was hot, but there is plenty of shady spots so we didn't have much of an issue (but remember, I'm from Florida :) )\n\n-Roman Forum/Palatine Hill. We got tickets to visit on our own. We had the Super Forum tickets and the extra money is well worth it. There are a few extra sites that are simply amazing. We really enjoyed Santa Maria Antiqua with Oratorio. (Plus they are nice and cool and offer a break in the heat if traveling in the summer)\n\n-We visited several churches, including Santa Maria Maggiore. Enjoyed several galleries but mostly spent the free time sightseeing and exploring Rome. Five days were not enough.\n\nFLORENCE\nThe city is simply amazing! The art oozes out of every building. Being in the architectural and design field, I was in heaven!\n\n-Ufizzi. It's a most. But plan for at least 4 hours. There is so much to see and we didn't get to finish it -and that wasn't even stopping to read a lot. We didn't have a tour, so we took our time, and breaks and then ran out of time LOL. We were there 3 hours and missed a few areas. We will return.\n\n-The Accademia. We had 8:15 tickets. There were only a handful of people inside and we got to spend as much time as we wanted visiting David and the rest of the gallery. By the time we left (about 1 1/2 hours later) the crowds inside were quite large and outside the line wrapped around the corner. Get tickets. There are lines with the time and you just line up in the correct time slot. It's easy. It's also wheelchair friendly -if you are traveling with someone a little tired (like my mom :) )\n\n-We had tickets to the Duomo's complex. If you want to get inside the church itself, you must get there early. It's free but the lines are long. The Baptistery is under renovations, so you can see the walls but not the actual baptistery (another excuse to go back!)\n\n-Palazzo Ricardi Medici is small, but worth a visit. You don't need tickets ahead of time. It can be visited in an hour.\n\nThere were other attractions, all worth visiting. (The view from Michaelangelo Piazza is gorgeous) We only had 3 1/2 days in Florence and felt that we covered a lot of ground just walking around, but will definitely would love to spend more time visiting Ufizzi and Palazzo Vecchio.\n\nSide trip to PISA.\n\nThis was planned at the last minute. Took the local train from Florence to Pisa at 5PM. It was crowded, hot and a true 'local' experience.\n\nThere are a few interesting sights in PISA including the main attraction -the leaning tower. But all took about a couple of hours to visit.\n\nAfter that, we strolled away from the touristy area and came to a really nice restaurant, where we had an amazing dinner.\n\nTook the train back to Florence and arrived close to midnight. All in all, it was a great side trip, never to come back again. (But I recommend a visit at least once. The architectural details and history of the tower are worth visiting and seeing)\n\nMILAN\nWe were here 2 days. Visited the main attractions, including the Duomo, Gallery and a little shopping :)\n\nThis city has more of a 'European' vibe. It reminded me a lot of Boston (USA) in some ways (for reference, I lived in Boston for 32 years). The old and the new coexisting.\n\nFrom here, we took the train to Bern. It was Ciao Italy. Until next time.\n\nAs general notes:\n\nRestaurants - we only made one reservation for dinner in Rome, and although excellent, not the highlight of the culinary experience.\n\nMay not be a popular opinion here, but most restaurants ARE open during the afternoon. We encountered only one that was open for drinks and just crossed the street to 3 that were open.\n\nWe had gelato every.single.day. :) in all cities. We visited Scudieri quite a bit while in Florence as they were closest to our hotel, but we just didn't have one bad gelato anywhere. Same for meals. Unplanned, unscheduled, totally worth the flexibility. You won't starve in Italy.\n\nBathrooms - never paid to use a single toilet room.\nPisa was the most challenging one as it was inside McDonals at the train station and it was dirty and could go in only by punching a code printed on a receipt from them. My code didn't work, so a few of us went in when someone came out.\nThe Roman forum toilet rooms (we used 4 of them) were clean, but out of toilet paper, but I learned in this group to take the ends of rolls with me everywhere. Only had to use them there. Thank you to whoever suggested that!!\n\nTrains - we travelled high speed Frecciarossa from Rome to Florence and Florence Milan. Fairly inexpensive and super convenient. We had booked tickets ahead of time, so perhaps that made a difference. We travelled Business Class and then first class on the train to Bern.\nYou need to find the train number on the board. A few minutes before the scheduled time, they will post the platform. You need to hurry up if you have a slow walker :)\n\nTaxis - No issues in Rome. Our hotel or restaurant would call them and they always showed up on time, and no one tried to 'scam' us. They are harder to come by in Florence. It was a bit of a challenge on day, but we managed to find one eventually.\n\nThe rates are higher on Sunday. Just be aware of that.\n\nFinally, what to wear.\nStop obsessing about what to wear. My dress style is relaxed casual. (not torn anything...:). I took what I wear at home. (I live in a tourist town, surrounded by tourists... :) )\nMost of what I took had shoulders (no spaghetti straps, etc) so I didn't have to worry too much about going into churches. Having said all that, people wear what they want! You are on vacation. Enjoy your favorite style and go with it. Be comfortable. You will never be like the locals. They dress nicely. But they are also not out and about all day. Dress nice, but comfortable -whatever that means for you- and you will be fine. No one cares.\n\nThings I took that were MUSTS.\n-Laundry detergent sheets and universal sink plug. Too much gelato meant a few stains. Plus it allowed us to keep up with washing a couple of tops in the sink.\n\n-Portable fan. This was a life-saver. Italians (Europeans in general) have no concept of COLD AC LOL. All our hotels had good AC, and 2 of them didn't have the card on the controls, so they could run all day if we wanted to. Still they never felt cold enough for me, so having the little fan was the ticket!\n\n-Hairdryer and Conditioner. This girl has to have her hairdryer, so I have one that is for travel only (not dual voltage, but 240v). Hotels have them, but not strong enough for my hair. Also none of the hotels had conditioner.\n\n-Comfortable shoes. I mostly wore my Aetrex sneakers, a pair of Aetrex sandals for 'dressier ocassions' and Vionic sneakers. My feet didn't hurt or got tired even with all the walking we did.\n\n-Linen. You will thank me later. Wrinkles and all. Stylish and comfortable.\n\n-Euros. We took about 500 with us. CC are accepted everywhere, but we left tips in hotels, tour guides, etc. and also used cash for small purchases. We found that some places wouldn't even have small change for cash purchases.\n\nThings that I didn't use\n-Rain jacket. It won't make the trip next time (unless it's in the 'rainy season'. Didn't take a whole lot of room, but totally unused. There is plenty of cover or you can buy a cheap umbrella is needed.\n\n-I used all the outfits I took, but some more than others. What seems cute at home (or even in Switzerland/France), were not the most comfortable ones in Italy. Again, linen is king.\n\n-Selfie stick. Can't use in some museums and if we wanted group pictures, we just asked another tourist to take ours in exchange for taking theirs. It was fine, but also we were a party of 3 (in Rome) and 4 in Florence.\n\n-Hydration packs. Just drink plenty of water. Save the agony of the taste and weight they add. There are water fountains everywhere.\n\nLast words\nGo with the flow! We had not major issues. We carried our passports EVERYWHERE. Did not need them once, including getting on the trains. I had a medium size travelon crossbody with a passport pouch inside attached to the bag where I kept cash and passport.\n\nWe never saw pickpocketing, but I also didn't take the metro or busses (except to Pisa). I kept the bag in front of my body and used a lanyard for my phone. It came in handy as I almost dropped it a couple of times.\n\nI know this has been a long post. If you are still reading, I hope you found it helpful! Most of all, ENJOY ITALY!!! It's wonderful. Relax, have fun and most importantly, plan a trip back! I'm already working on it. \ud83d\ude0d", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2199848917080853/", "likes": 933, "comments": [{"username": "Pamela J.
