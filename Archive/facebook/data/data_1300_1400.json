Here is some info from our time in Florence.\n\nAccommodation: we booked an Airbnb in Santo Spirito and loved the neighborhood. Great restaurants, small shops, near Pitti Palace but not as touristy and busy as across the river. Loved our 2 bed 2 bath apartment.\n\nhttps://abnb.me/jfTpUF9e5Bb\n\nOn our first day we did a free 2 hour walking tour with Guru Walks, we tipped the guide $50 euros for the 3 of us. It was a great orientation to the history and sites to kick off our time in Florence. You can also book the guide we had directly, she was very knowledgeable and loved the history of Florence. storytellingflorence@gmail.com\n\nRestaurants and food:\nbest meal in Florence was at Oliviero on Via delle Terme, Loggia Rooftop Bar was lovely spot for drinks - book a reservation, Trattoria La Casalinga was very good as well.\nBest spots we found in Santa Spirito for reasonable priced breakfasts and espressos were Pitti Express Caffe and Pitti Bistrot & Bakery, for anyone needing closest thing to Starbucks and milk alternatives Ditta Artiginale Sprone was great and they had great pancakes but not a cheap spot.\nTuscan Taste Florence was a quaint wine shop that also had wine by glass and cheeses. The bakery at end of our street was very good - Forno Pintucci. The gelato close to the bakery was best we had in Florence- Gelateria Artigianale La Sorbetteria on Via Mazzetta.\n\nPitti Palace was amazing. Get ticket that includes gardens only if you are up for a hike but they are stunning. Try to go on day not too hot as palace is warm and gardens are also hot. You do not need to buy in advance.\n\nUffizi - daughters did a walk up to ticket window for 9am and had no issue getting in - was a Friday morning not sure if that mattered, we saw very long lines later in the day for ticket window.\n\nTransport - took train from Rome to Venice and grabbed a taxi at station. taxis easy and friendly. Husband also rented scooters regularly as they were everywhere to grab.\n\nWe took a taxi to and from Florence, 100 euros each way, to do the Tour and Tuscan snack at Frescobaldi. The snack was a delicious charcuterie and 3 glasses of wine in the formal dining room. Loved it.\n\nWe also went to Santa Maria Novella perfumeria. If you love soaps, scents, creams and perfume you must go. The store is stunning and they have been making scents since 1221.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2209000952832316/", "likes": 10, "comments": []}, {"id": "2209010862831325", "text": "Final post with learnings from our trip:\n\nWe purchased the USB fan from Amazon\nbased on someone\u2019s suggestion in this group and glad we did.

I really like my Diet Coke and all they have is Coke Zero. Literally in 10 days I did not find it once.\n\nBring a water bottle. Rome has lots of the free flowing fountains and we found places to fill up in Florence.\n\nNo issues with pick pockets or feeling unsafe. Use common sense. Don\u2019t dress dripping with jewelry or expensive bags in busy tourist areas.\n\nOnly place we had to show passport was at a store if we wanted them to do the VAT refund paperwork. Which they did and it made it super easy at airport.\n\nAmerican style drip coffee is non-existent. Americano with adding some milk closest to it.\nBring individual coffee packets like those from Starbucks so you can make your own in Airbnb if you want to have aome. Our 2 air bnbs only had nespresso machines and we could then only find americano or espresso pods.\n\nIf you want real gelato don\u2019t eat the gelato piles in mounds. Real gelato is under covered metal lids as melting point is low. The stuff in view trying to entice you has more additives and more like a regular ice cream.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go to places that are not everywhere on social media. Italy has so many great museums, palazzos and galleries beyond the few being over promoted online which mean they are also very very busy.\n\nPls don\u2019t litter.
