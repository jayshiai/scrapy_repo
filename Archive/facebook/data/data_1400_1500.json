She asked if I spoke Spanish and I told her yes. First she asked if I could share \u201ccell phone service\u201d with her\u2026 first red flag. She explained that her brother was on the way to almafi and was coming via bus. She said\ufffc she didn\u2019t have service so she just wanted to let him know that she would be waiting for him at the beach and their dad would be waiting for him at the bus stop. I must have looked confused so she went to her own phone and went into settings\u2026 I did the same. I asked her if she meant hotspot and she said no\u2026 she then proceeded to ask if she could use my phone to call her brother\u2026 Second red flag as now I was scared she would take my phone and take off running. I offered to send her brother a text instead, and she insisted it be through WhatsApp\u2026 she insisted she could type it herself, but at this point, I was starting to feel uncomfortable, so I just told her I would send it myself so I can get rid of her. The male had a germany phone number\u2026. Another red flag!!!! She thanked me and left. I then received a phone call from a friend and began to chat with them. As I was still talking to my friend on the phone, I received a phone call from her supposed brother, but since I was already on the phone, I did not answer. As I looked around for the girl\nShe was, of course, nowhere in sight. The whole situation still never set right with me. The following morning when I woke up I was notified that my \u200eWhatsApp account was flagged for spam, and it was permanently deleted. I can\u2019t say for sure that text message was the culprit, but my gut feeling told me that it had something to do with it. The more I think about it my theory is that if I would\u2019ve answered that guys phone call, he would\u2019ve started asking me for money and gave me some Sob story about how he was stuck at the train station with no money and needed funds\u2026 I\u2019m also thinking that that female had already been reported and that alleged Germany phone number was flagged thus my WhatsApp account was also flagged. I just wanted to share this quick story and remind everybody to stay vigilant and if something doesn\u2019t feel right, go with your gut feeling and stay safe. \ufffc", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2208788616186883/", "likes": 115, "comments": [{"username": "Sony Ucciferri", "comment_text": "I will not help anyone no matter what !

Considering our travel options for Florence > Positano in mid September. (Planning to travel one day.) Should we take a train to Naples & take a ferry to Positano? Or rent a car and drive from Florence to Naples & take the ferry? First time to Italy, so weighing out our options! Any advice or tips are helpful :)\n\nSide note, we'll actually be coming from Panzano so if we did the train, we'd need to backtrack back to Florence to get a train. Wondering if a car might be more relaxing even though it'll take longer?", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2208876072844804/", "likes": 0, "comments": [{"username": "Karl Cvelbar", "comment_text": "Positano and the Amalfi coast needs more than a couple of hours.

Planning a trip in October for my oldest who graduated college and has moved away. I have airline tickets booked and most hotels. I\u2019m doing a mix of staying on points (thus the locations selected) and staying at boutique hotels. Here is our general itinerary:\nRome 1 night\nPisa or Grotta Giusti Resort (Tuscany) 3 nights\nSorrento 3 nights\nRome 1 night\nBiggest thing keeping me from being able to finalize lodging and activities is transportation. One of our excursions starts in Florence but we want to be on our own the rest of the days there. We also want to check out Cinque Terre area so the car feels necessary.\n\nWe get in at 1300 to Rome after an overnight flight so our initial thought was to stay in Rome for one night then head up to Tuscany. But I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s going to be a bigger pain than just heading up that same day.\nDo we get the car in Rome and drive up or are we better off taking the train? If we rent a car, is the airport the only option for picking it up?\nIf we get a car for Tuscany can I drop it off there and take the train down to the coast? Or are we better off getting a flight from Florence to the coast?\nThanks in advance and apologies for the basic questions, but I haven\u2019t been to Italy since I was seven. \ud83d\ude06", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2208876419511436/", "likes": 1, "comments": [{"username": "Autumn Watson", "comment_text": "We stayed in Rome and explored by foot.

You need to notify the group leader/tour operator at what point/\nlocation you want to leave the tour. Returning to your lodging is your responsibility, by the way.\nRental car. Many rental car agencies are available in Roma throughout the city, especially at Roma Termini station. The most important thing is where you are going to drop off the car. Use Google Map and punch in your desired town of choice and see who has an office there. We usually take train to the furthest we can go before picking up our car. Last time we rented a car in Toscana, we picked up a car when leaving Firenze and returned it in Orvieto, then took a train to Roma.\nFatigue from a long flight should be taken in consideration. We are not a big fan of picking up a car at the airport especially immediately after long journey(we start from LA), so we take a train(rest time for us) as far as we can, then pick up a car if necessary. Italian railroad system is impressively well connected. Unless you are going to the countryside, it is more efficient to take advantage of the fabulous train system. For example, we took a high speed train from Firenze to Bologna and picked up a car there instead of driving from Firenze. I do understand that there are people who only want to drive a car to everywhere and avoid trains at all cost.\nI hope that my experience helps.\nIn the end, you have to decide how you want to execute your plan.\nHappy Planning!"}, {"username": "Piera Angeletti", "comment_text": "Very good tips!!

You can always pre book online next year closer to your date. I recommend this as the Amalfi Coast is popular especially in the Spring and Summer months. This is a beautiful trip by water. Check ferry hopper online for schedules.You can take the train to Sorrento but will then have to take a bus to the towns on the Coast as the train does not run along the Coast.Will take longer to get there.\nAnother way of seeing it is to take a tour of the coast with a tour company if you choose to do that.You can get to Vietri sul Mare from Amalfi by ferry.

We returned from Greece to Naples, took the bus to Sorrento, stayed one night (I wish it had been longer) then took the boat back to Naples, got to our b&b, hit Pompeii, and the next morning were up at 4am for our flight to Genoa. (I would definitely like to explore Naples for a few days also\u2026.In Genoa we took the train to La Spezia where we were staying\u2026.then visited two of the 5 Cinque Terre villages\u2026.then next day train back to Rome for two days. I had gotten heat stroke in Pompeii, so that killed the end of our adventures in Cinque Terra and Rome sadly\u2026.we had planned a night in between CT to go back to Florence but went right to Rome instead. I was just happy to be able to catch my flight home without any sickness issues\u2026..defini\ntely pack Imodium and pepto bismol\u2026if needed it will be easier than searching when not feeling well\u2026anyway now from experience\u2026.I definitely will not spend only one night in any place ever again\u2026.it\u2019s just too much of a pain to pack up and move on a daily basis\u2026at least for me. Definitely prebook hotels if possible, luckily the person I travelled with had some time share options and that worked out well budget wise, but last minute hotels in July would have been crazy expensive.
