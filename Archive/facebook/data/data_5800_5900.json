If you're looking for a good value, try to find restaurants that are off the beaten path.\n* **Look for lunch specials.** Many restaurants in Rome and Venice offer lunch specials that are much cheaper than their dinner menus. You can often get a main course, side dish, and drink for around \u20ac10-\u20ac15.\n* **Share dishes.** If you're not that hungry, you can share a main course between two people. This is a great way to save money and try new dishes.\n* **Order tap water.** Bottled water is very expensive in Italy, so it's best to order tap water instead. Most restaurants will serve it for free.\n\nHere are some specific examples of meals that you could get for \u20ac200 per day in Rome and Venice:\n\n* **Lunch:**\n* Pizza: \u20ac8-\u20ac10\n* Pasta: \u20ac10-\u20ac15\n* Sandwich: \u20ac5-\u20ac7\n* Salad: \u20ac5-\u20ac8\n* **Dinner:**\n* Pasta with meat or seafood: \u20ac15-\u20ac20\n* Pizza: \u20ac10-\u20ac15\n* Risotto: \u20ac15-\u20ac20\n* Steak: \u20ac20-\u20ac30\n\nOf course, you could spend more or less than \u20ac200 per day on food, depending on your preferences.

Haha, no such luck. Cobblestones awash, our Jeans soaked up to the knees. Took refuge in the Pantheon, but of course the marble floor was so slippery and dangerous. We were having a good laugh about our trials, but they weren\u2019t over. The bus pickup point was a nightmare,took ages standing in the rain before we could access the bus. Then guess what the same family held us up again! By this time we were leaving Rome in peak hour and it was a slow crawl out of the city. We would have missed the sailing if the bus hadn\u2019t been booked through the ship. Managed to retain our senses of humour, but decided never to leave a ship for Rome again.\nSo my suggestion is to take a ships tour to the Colosseum.

Cheaper tickets and better options for seat selection. We did business class for each train\nThe Fork - Restaurant reservations\n**We did about 40% reservations. Many did not take reservations. Arrive at 7:30-8pm and there is minimal wait time to be seated\nGoogle Translate: the image feature was so helpful in translating menus\n\nPhone: We did the AT&T $10 International day pass and it worked fantastic! No issues the entire time\n\nCurrency: We only took $400 euros with us that I had ordered through our bank. It was perfect for us because many places took credit card. We have the Capitol One Venture card which has a zero transaction fee internationally.\n\nPickpocketing: no issue but we both took precautions with our front crossbodies\n\nPacking: We each only took a backpack and carryon. Packing cubes were a life saver! I got 20 outfits in one cube. Personally, I strongly advise packing lighter because of all the walking.\n*** Essential items: Front crossbody, portable iPhone charger, tide pens, RFID passport wallet, sunscreen, collapsible water bottle, and comfortable shoes\n\nHiccups: Every trip has them right? Well on our way from Florence to Rome on the train, my husband and I accidentally got off at the wrong stop\u2026. But not only that, I left my crossbody bag (which had my passport, credit cards, drivers license, and money) in the train seat. After a minor panic attack we went to the ticket office where an employee was able to call the train and locate my bag. I was able to get it back 4 hours later!\n\n******Research, research, and more research! I can\u2019t say enough how doing researchprior to our trip was so important. We were able to be present in the moment and really make the most of the time we had. Also, only scheduling one activity per day and setting time aside for breaks was life saving.\n\nIt truly was a trip of a lifetime \u2764\ufe0f", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2195324237533321/", "likes": 758, "comments": [{"username": "Irene Oda", "comment_text": "Congratulations\n.
