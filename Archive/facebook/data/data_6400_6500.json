These buses are supposed to run hourly till 9pm. You use the normal Sita bus tickets. Unfortunately, our fellow tourists didn't see the need for queuing (some who arrived late shamelessly pushed themselves to the front) and getting a seat on the bus actually involved a lot of shoving!

I like to have most stuff in one place that I can always pay attention to and have on my person. But I will have a card in a secret place as a fail safe. You can also leave stuff in a safe if there's one at your accommodation, but thefts from hotels do happen. I trust myself and my attention more than anything else, and definately more than any brand or item recommended. I thinBank cards, get modern internet bank account cards so you can instantly cancel if lost or stolen. Lots of old school banks are very poor for this kinda thing. I have a chase, Revolut and Monzo, and Tide for my business. All cancellable within a minute or less on my phone. sure the phone could be stolen too - haha.

We are a family of 6 (our kids are 15, 12, 10 & 6) travelling from Australia.\n\nOur Italian itinerary was:\n\nMilan - only stayed 2 nights, primarily for my husband & sons to attend a football match at San Siro. They had an absolute ball!\n\nTrain to Venice.\n\nVenice - stayed in a very cool & quirky Airbnb for 3 nights. Loved Venice, just walking around & getting lost. Took a tour boat to Murano & Burano one day which was interesting, especially the glass blowing demo. I probably couldn\u2019t have stayed longer with the kids\u2026 anywhere they tried to kick a ball they got told off & so it was enough time with them (could absolutely go back without them sometime & enjoy some nicer restaurants etc \ud83e\udd23).\n\nTrain to Bologna.\n\nBologna - loved it! Food was amazing, definitely the best we had in Italy. Gelato is amazing here! We got tickets on the day to walk up the tower, I was scared (I\u2019m terrified of heights!), but all the kids were fine. View from the top is pretty great. I loved that they closed the main streets around the Piazza over the weekend to cars, it had a nice \u2018festival\u2019 vibe. Our Airbnb here was also great. Spent a morning at Giardini Margherita, where the kids got to kick the ball freely & enjoyed a game with some local children! We had 4 nights here & felt that was a good amount of time. We did a day trip to Modena & checked out the markets/bought parmigiano/tasted balsamic vinegar, which made for a fun day.\n\nTrain to Levanto.\n\nLevanto - we stayed in a beautiful farmhouse through Airbnb that I cannot recommend highly enough (except the stairs to get back up\u2026 if you have a car, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue!). We stayed here to explore 5 Terre because we met up with friends & needed a big house, which I couldn\u2019t find in any of the 5 CT towns. Levanto was beautiful though & we spent half a day on a small boat looking at the CT towns from the water & it was a highlight of our entire trip. We also caught the train to the towns & hiked between Corniglia, Vernazza & Monterroso. Definitely more of a hike than a walk & it was a bit challenging at times keeping kids motivated, but we got there in the end & all loved it. We explored RioMaggiore & Manarola by train separately & loved Nessun Dorma for drinks/dinner!\n\nTrain to Florence via Pisa.\n\nPisa - we literally stored our bags near the station & walked to the leaning tower. It\u2019s a bit of a trek, but totally worth it, we had a lot of fun trying to get the pictures right!\n\nFlorence - I could write a novel on all the ways I loved Florence! Someone here mentioned the Benheart store for leather & this was honestly one of the highlights of our trip. Ben was in the store & he (& his staff) are an absolute joy to be around! He had my kids in the street playing football while we browsed & honestly, the BEST shopping experience ever, I couldn\u2019t walk into another leather shop after that, nothing could compare to our experience in there. We saw David & he is obviously incredible (I had pre-booked tickets for him & the Galleria Dell\u2019Accademia) & we spent a lot of time just walking & looking at everything (we didn\u2019t go into the Duomo, just admired it from outside). We were here 3 nights & could have happily stayed longer!\n\nWe then hired a car from Europcar (in the city) & I have to say, it was the worst car hire experience we\u2019ve had. They didn\u2019t have the car we\u2019d booked months prior, then tried to blame it on us being there late (we had been there on time & had to stand in the queue for ages). It just went on & on, they were so rude, it was horrid. Anyway! We got a smaller car than we needed, so it was a squish, but we got everyone in & headed to Tuscany.\n\n(Note\u2026 we had so many dramas trying to get a cab to take us from our accom to the car hire, they kept declining us & Uber doesn\u2019t exist in Florence\u2026 so keep this in mind! If I\u2019d known I would have organised a transfer car. We got a cab easily from the train station to our accom, there\u2019s a big line for them there).\n\nTuscany - we had a week at Agriturismo Diacceroni & it was great. I wouldn\u2019t have stayed there without kids, it was a little bit \u201csummer camp\u201d, but with kids it was perfect. We lazed by the pool, the kids did some horse riding, we did a pizza & pasta making course & a truffle hunt. The on-site restaurant was great & the apartment was really big. Would definitely recommend if you\u2019re traveling with children! We did drive around to a few of the towns nearby & really loved them all. We did a winery tour at Fattoria Il Piano near San Gimignano & it was excellent.\n\nFrom there we returned the car to Florence & got the train to Naples.\n\nNaples - because we were only there for 2 nights (primarily to see Pompeii), I booked an Airbnb near the train station. The actual apartment was fantastic, but the area was a bit so-so. We never felt unsafe, it was just FULL of rubbish! We stepped over a rat amongst it all one day. We caught the train to Pompeii & had a tour with a guide I found on Airbnb experiences. She was brilliant, I would highly recommend her, especially for kids. That afternoon I booked a Spanish Quarter tour through GetYourGuide which I really enjoyed, but it was probably too much in one day for the kids, they were exhausted! They did love the Maradona stuff though! We had dinner at Trattoria Nennella (got there 20min before it opened & lined up), which was lots of fun - they turn the music on & the waiters all dance & sing, the kids LOVED this!\n\nFlew Ryanair to Cagliari.\n\nSardinia - wow, this place is beautiful! We picked up a car at Cagliari airport & drove to our Airbnb in Costa Rei. It was a drive to the beach, but it didn\u2019t matter because we wanted to explore a few anyway. We visited a few of the beaches up & down the coast & they were all magnificent! We organised a last minute snorkelling tour for half a day through a dive centre in Villasimius & this turned out to be a great idea! We did 2 fairly long snorkels in beautiful clear blue water, everyone really enjoyed this. The company was Archeo Diving & they were really excellent. Villasimius was a cool town, we really liked hanging out there. We had 4 nights, but could have spent a lot more, it is paradise!\n\nFlew ITA Airways to Rome.\n\nRome - it was HOT!!! Really, really hot, almost unbearable. Thankfully our Airbnb had aircon. We stayed in Monti right behind the Roman Forum & it was a great apartment & spot. We did a Colosseum tour through LivTours, initially we had booked the underground tour, but we were victims of the cancellations, so it got changed. The Roman Forum part of the tour was interesting for me, but for the kids in the heat (& so soon after Pompeii, perhaps), it was just a long, hot day! Once we got into the Colosseum everyone really loved it, but 3 hours was a long time. We also did an early morning Vatican Museum/Sistine Chapel tour with LivTours, which started at 7:30 (although we did still have to queue until it opened at 8am). This was also really interesting for me\u2026 but probably went largely over the kids\u2019 heads. Personally, I thought the 2 LivTours we did were really great, but in hindsight I may have looked harder for a tour guide that could tailor things more to the children, they were quite \u2018serious\u2019 information/content-heavy. Our guide in Pompeii navigated offering interesting info to us, while also engaging the kids so well, it was always going to be hard for anyone else to stack up!\n\nWe walked around Trastevere one afternoon & felt a bit like we were missing something\u2026 we didn\u2019t really find any cool shops or anything interesting like I\u2019d read. Maybe we were in the wrong place?! My daughter did get her ears pierced here though & I was really impressed with the shop that we had it done at. We found exactly what we thought we\u2019d find in Trastevere, in Monti (right near where we stayed) though! Lots of cool arty shops, another lovely guy making beautiful leather pieces & good restaurants/bars. We actually stumbled across a brilliant burger bar here (T&C), right when everyone was feeling a bit over pasta & pizza!\n\nOtherwise we walked ALOT around Rome! We went to the Pantheon the day after they introduced the new ticketing system & I had bought us each a ticket for \u20ac6 online. There was such confusion though with the new system that no one knew what was going on & tension between customers & staff got a bit high at times. They had various queues & people who hadn\u2019t pre-booked tickets were walking right in while we had to stand & wait, it was chaos. I hope they\u2019ve ironed out those kinks by now!\n\nAnother great thing we did in Rome was an early morning running tour (through Airbnb experiences). We met the guide at 6:30am & did about 10km past all the main points of interest - even though we\u2019d already seen them, it was so cool to see the Colosseum without anyone around it & likewise for the other places. If you like running, I would highly recommend this, it was a great way to see the city & the guides were excellent!\n\nWe had 5 nights in Rome & it was probably 1 or 2 nights too many - perhaps because it was so hot, or perhaps having the kids & not being able to hop between restaurants like I would without them, we just kind of felt like there wasn\u2019t a lot else we could do after we\u2019d seen all the \u2018hot spots\u2019. It was probably the heat making us all grumpy \ud83e\udd23.\n\nTrain to Venice Mestre.\n\nMestre - yes, we backtracked. Only because we booked our sons into the AC Milan Junior Football Camp in Cortina after I\u2019d booked everything else! So we had a night at the Anda Venice Hostel near Mestre station & it was actually awesome (had another night a week later on our way back). Of course, the kids think it was the best accommodation ever!!! We hired a car from Alamo at the train station (easiest car hire ever, can recommend!).\n\nCortina D\u2019Ampezzo - WOW! This place is amazing, we LOVED it! I can\u2019t put into words how beautiful the Dolomites are, they really took my breath away every day. We stayed in the Hotel Alaska (the kids stayed here with the camp & we thought it best to stay close this time) & it was fantastic. The town of Cortina has lots of shops & great restaurants/bars. We drove around a bit to other towns/lakes & they were all gorgeous. We hired e-bikes one day & rode for half a day, lots of fun & great scenery! We caught the gondola up to a wine bar (Masi Wine Bar) which was fab - great wine & those views are perfection!!! We can\u2019t wait to come back, it is a really magical spot!\n\nWe drove back to Mestre to fly out of Venice airport for Greece.\n\nI booked all our train tickets through ItaliaRail & it was super easy. The train between Levanto & Florence wasn\u2019t available to book until a couple of weeks prior, that was a little stressful, but we got there in the end! I booked business class seats where possible - it was nice to have assigned seats & a bit of space. There was always room for our bags above the seats or between seats.\n\nWe took backpacks with zip-off daypacks rather than suitcases. This has worked well for us as we haven\u2019t had to wheel cases on cobblestones etc. & getting on/off trains has been totally fine. We have had to buy one extra bag so far though\u2026 the shopping here is great!!!\n\nWe used Stasher & Bounce to store bags - just check the reviews on the places you\u2019re using & it should be fine. For us it worked really well. My preference though, is for stowyourbags.com We used them numerous times & it is just so easy. If there is one near where you\u2019re going, I\u2019d really recommend. Just book online & then use the code once you get there, such a great system.\n\nWe have loved exploring Italy, it\u2019s been a great place to bring the kids. We\u2019ve felt safe the entire time & met some really beautiful people along the way!\n\nI will happily answer any questions, but we are still traveling for another month, so if I\u2019m slow to reply, please forgive me!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2193257434406668/", "likes": 304, "comments": [{"username": "Kellie Suffell", "comment_text": "Hi Aym\u00e9e Hogbin we are doing a similar trip can I pop you a DM?"}, {"username": "Gemma F O'Brien", "comment_text": "Would you please DM me the air Bnb links for your stay?

If u follow to the end u will be at Fornilla Beach. All beaches in Positano r black sand\nCall in to the local church up the stairs to the square just ti the right from ferry stop to see Black Madonna. Walk up all the stairs to town square. Catch the local orange bus, tickets at bar opposite that goes round in circle around mountain top and back down perhaps ask driver for International bar stop and then slowly meander your way down the mountain taking in the houses above and below, the incredible views that make Positano magic\nSeveral restaurants on the way for a drink. Not necessarily with a view, but friendly, reasonable. I luv the 1 part way down after the after the Fontanio. A fountain with a crib.\nThat has tables, umbrellas on the left as u walk down. Lovely light pizzas to share and food for lunch .\nOften eat dinner here I will be in Positano in September for 3 weeks 9th visit if u waiting for Ferrybti return, walk down to the beach, Go to Chez Black to have a drink, cocktail, watch the world gi by, or walk up to the left almost to the end beach, a lovely leafy cool place with tables, reasonable.\nOf course u can do Walk of the Gods, cooking classes etc if u wish.

Get the Funicular from the harbor to Capri town and enjoy the town and the harbor area. Lots to see and do.

It cost $150 aus $ for the two of us with included food and drinks which was less then what we spent on our last stopover in a bar at Dubai (we only had two drinks ).

But you don\u2019t get to choose the hotel and it is outside the airport so you have to do the whole check in security stuff again for ongoing flights.

I was happy with our time in Venice, but I really wish I'd had an extra 2 days in Rome and at least one other day in Florence. Don't try to do everything in that amount of time. Give yourself enough time in each city to really explore and hit the sites and activities that you want to experience in each town. This was my first time traveling to Europe in over 30 years and I was nervous about handling the planning on my own, particularly transportation.\nEach of these cities is very very walkable, and the trains are easy to use. I found that going through tour groups did cost more money and I wanted the freedom to be able to follow our own agenda. In the end. I am very glad that we did this trip on her own, in part because my daughter got sick for 2 days while we were traveling and the ability to change our schedule and let her stay in and rest with me checking in on her was much easier then if we had been obligated to be on a tour bus or locked into visiting particular sites at a particular time. As long as you plan ahead, and book the most important activities that you want to see ahead of time, you can absolutely do this on your own! Easy to get around in Italy, most people speak English, most of the signs are in both English and Italian, and in planning it yourself, you have complete control over where you stay (say, center of town rather than on the outskirts, if you prefer), how long you could stay at each venue (if you want to spend half a day at the Uffizi rather than an hour with the tour company's guide), and you can change things up easily. We really needed to take midday breaks in the heat of summer, which I'm not sure would have been as easy to do if we needed to get back on the tour bus at a certain time. You can do it!
