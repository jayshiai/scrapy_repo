Took metro here as well. LOTS of walking.\nRode bikes through Villa Borghese\nTook bus to walk around Trastavere\n\nEuro rail to Venice. So charming and quaint.\nMore expensive and sisnt find the food outstanding and yet being in Naples and Rome. Was able to see everything in 1.5 days\n\nMy kids wore Birks. They were fine.

Bologna is a relaxing little city, count a dinner and a lunch in different typical restaurants. Choose on TripAdvisor restaurants with several top reviews by italians (when I travel I prefer the places chosen only by the natives). After lunch leave for Florence and dedicate to this city at least two days: Duomo square, Palazzo Vecchio out and in, Academia for the David, Palazzo del Bargello and of course a picture of and from Ponte Vecchio!! For Dinner Fiorentina steak with Chianti wine, no vegetarians (sorry). Pisa I would jump it to leave a bit of time to see Rome: at least the center with the most important attractions and the Roman Ruins, count again a lunch and dinner at a local trattoria. There is a famous one that I'd like to visit myself, known as the Sora Lella's after a famous Italian comic actress that owned it herself. Now it should be her nephew's. In Naples remember to eat Pizza Margherita or Marinara everywhere (it is amazing in every single pizzeria) and don't wait in line for the most famous because it's a pity to lose time in a city where pizza art is everywhere.

Congestion beyond your wildest expectations occurs every day.\n\nTo drive it with less stress we like to get up very early, eat breakfast and then be out and actually ON on the coast road before 8am. Since most of the tour buses and most drivers aren\u2019t on the road until about 10am getting this early of a start helps to avoid the worst of the congestion. And since the actual distance between towns on the Amalfi is pretty small you can be in your destination early enough to find parking and explore the town befure the elbow to elbow hordes descend. We stay in that one town, exploring, enjoying a long, leisurely lunch, shopping , taking photos, or relaxing on the beach (whatever we feel like doing) until late afternoon when the tour buses leave. Then we drive to our next destination or back to our base town when the buses and the majority of drivers are gone fur the day. This strategy helps a lot! I\u2019d recommend it. Not only will you have less congestion on the road itself but you will have a more enjoyable time in each town before and after the masses are out in full force.\n\nI believe there are some YouTube videos that show what driving on the Amalfi Coast is like.
