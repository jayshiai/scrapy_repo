[{"id": "2196938470705231", "text": "Ciao!\n\nFirst time poster in this group, but wanted to share some of my experiences from my first three days in this beautiful country - Rome in particular.\n\nI am travelling with my Mum who is in her mid-60\u2019s. These are just our experiences, we understand that everyone is and travels differently!\n\nCrowds\n- Visit the sites early to avoid the crowds. We have been leaving the hotel (in Trastevere) at 7am and walking to the sites. There have been very few people around at this time of morning, and it is quite serene walking the quiet streets at that time of day.\nNOTE - obviously if you are going into the sites you are bound by it\u2019s opening hours, so crowds will be unavoidable.\n- From 9am onwards you can see a noticeable difference in the crowds building.\n\nHeat\n- It has been super hot and humid, however we have been getting up early and sight seeing before the heat really kicks in at around 10am.\n- Take a hand held fan (we bought some from home but they sell them everywhere here and are very cheap) - these make all the difference.\n- Always carry a bottle of water and wear a hat (water is also very easily accessible at stores).\n- We have been relaxing in our hotel in the hottest afternoon hours and enjoying siestas \u263a\ufe0f.\n\nSafety\n- We have not felt unsafe at all. Definitely pay more attention to your belongings around the main tourist sites - cross body bags for your most important belongings are great.\n- Goes without saying, but have your wits about you and be aware of your surroundings (as you should wherever you are travelling in the world \ud83d\ude0a).\n- We haven\u2019t ridden any busses, however these look super packed when they drive by, so probably hold your bags very close on these.\n\nAfter reading some of the comments in this group I was feeling a little nervous about coming here with my Mum, however we have absolutely loved every second of our stay so far! Rome is so, so charming and yes the heat has made us adjust our ways of sight seeing, but it has not stopped us from doing anything we had planned to do!!\n\nOff to Positano today, and cannot wait \ud83e\udd70", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2196938470705231/", "likes": 1080, "comments": [{"username": "Daniela Horth", "comment_text": "Beautiful \u2764\ufe0f"}, {"username": "Lena Holmes", "comment_text": "Where do you stay in Rome?"}, {"username": "Connie Dennis", "comment_text": "You are beautiful and your Mom also, and she doesn't look in her 60's either!\nThanks for the information \ud83e\udd17"}, {"username": "Cynthia Rodriguez", "comment_text": "Thank you for sharing!

Plus it charges no foreign transaction fees snd it reimburses any frees charged by the ATM itself. We use this only for travel, transferring funds into it before a trip snd ignoring it between trips. We\u2019ve used it on trips to numerous countries on several continents. Never once had a problem of any kind. It\u2019s easy and convenient.\n\nWe use a charge card for hotels and most expenses but the debit card to get local currency at our destination.\n\nYou can apply for this card online.
