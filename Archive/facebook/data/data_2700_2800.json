Sorry for the long post!\n\n2 nights Venice - beautiful city but the bridges with large luggage was a nightmare, would definitely book a hotel close to a water bus drop off point 10 euro pp, otherwise you would need a water taxi and preferably one with a lift if you have a fair amount of luggage \ud83d\ude02. Definitely listen when people say pack light! Also one of the days we had was scorching hot and none of the shops have air con \ud83d\udd25We loved just walking and getting lost and then coming out to a piazza, we also had the most amazing food at De Carletta. Taxis on the mainland were impossible to find, overpriced and there is no Uber etc. We also did not realize they only take cash. But when u are needing to get to a flight you do whatever you need to do to get there. We ended up walking a few km\u2019s with luggage to find one but maybe it was because it was a Sunday. We also found the taxi app couldn\u2019t find our location and to call they don\u2019t speak English \ud83d\ude29\n\n3 nights Sorrento - flew with Ryan air to Naples, we had no problem whatsoever and hand luggage wasn\u2019t looked at. Caught a bus to Sorrento which proved harder than expected to find it was about 800m up the road and bus didn\u2019t have much air con but was an ok way to travel. In our 2 days we spent half a day exploring Sorrento which was enough as there isn\u2019t much there, then went to Pompeii by train which was easy. A guided tour 4.30 tour was perfect as it wasn\u2019t hot\ud83e\udd75 Our second day we did a boat tour to Capri, just our opinion but at this time of the season especially it was very overrated. Crowed, hot and waiting in long lines for the cable car to go to overpriced restaurants and shops. We ended up getting the public bus which proved much quicker. It also didn\u2019t help that we booked late online and I feel our tour was very overpriced, for a trip with 12 people to the island and a short trip around it with a swimming stop, (blue grotto was closed) 160 euro pp. Next time I would book from the mainland directly. Food was amazing in Sorrento especially the orange tree and Qui bistro \ud83e\udd70\n\n1 night Rome - we caught the ferry to Naples which was great but a 30euro taxi for 7mins drive \ud83d\ude2cagain no Uber and had to get hotel to call and book, then another 20euro from airport to train. Next time would just take the train from Sorrento. We were supposed to catch the fast train but were rushing and caught the slow train instead so got in one hr late \ud83d\ude29 note to self triple check train numbers! Once in Rome at 11am we did the hop on hop off bus which was great and stopped near all the major attractions. We even got a last minute guided tour of the colosseum at the gate 40 euro pp. We ticked off all of the major places all by 4pm \ud83d\udc4c\n\n1 night Florence - We arrived by train to Florence and went straight to our highlight tour of the trip. Booked through viator Fun in Tuscany a horse ride through the vineyards, with a stop at San Grimiono and 3 course lunch with wine tasting at a winery. It was all amazing would highly recommend! Approx 200euro pp 8hrs. They also stored our luggage in the bus and waited when our train was 10 minutes late. That night we went up to Michelangelo\u2019s piazza to watch the sunset, it was very busy so get there early but was amazing \ud83e\udd29. The final day we walked Florence and seen most of the major landmarks whilst shopping for the best priced leather we found in the markets.\n\nAll in all we had an amazing time even though it was short and we learnt a lot.

Here's what I would do for my first trip to Italy (and what I in fact did do for my first trip there) though I imagine that I'm probably in the minority:\n\nFirst of all, don't go in the summer or even the late spring or early fall. I would completely black out my vacation calendar from April 21th - September 21th. That still leaves you with 7 months! Unless you just feel that you *must* lay on the beach and get in the water. In which case I would try to avoid July and *for sure* avoid August.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, don't go to any of the *major* tourist destinations! Venice, Rome, Cinque Terra, Florence, Pisa, Tuscan countryside, Amalfi Coast, and Lake Como. Or, go to just one and for just 1-2 days. The rest of the time should be spent at any number of places that are awesome, which is the vast majority of Italy! Almost everywhere in the country is a tourist destination, and that includes 100s of places that you've likely never heard of! Trust me on this, you will see amazing beauty and culture in other places which will fulfill you and make you feel as if you have had a full vacation while not having to navigate the hordes and compete for all the same services as so many others are also competing for. Not to mention that you will avoid so many of the places that just exist to get those tourism dollars and therefore aren't such an authentic aspect of Italy.\n\nIf you must go in the summer but you avoid the most touristy of tourist areas, you'll find that while others are on pages like this complaining about how busy it is, that you are having a grand time in places with a more manageable tourist population.\n\nThere are loads of places that are jaw-droppingly amazing, similar to the places that are jam-packed that you can go to. Really. You want Lake Como? Go to Lake Iseo (or Lake Garda or Lake Maggiore for busy but not as busy as Lake Como). You want Tuscany? Go to Umbria. You want Rome, go to Bologna. You won't be disappointed. And there's lots of other fantastic places to visit. 100s of places that if any of them were in the U.S. they would be the biggest tourist destinations in the country. But also just as old and special and beautiful as most of what you\u2019ll see in those more famous places.\n\nLoads of us can give you ideas of where to go."}, {"username": "Starla Dawn", "comment_text": "First time last month did great."}, {"username": "Angela Mcnamara", "comment_text": "I did 4 days in Rome first, in February, I had a list of things to do and did them all without queues, rain or any problems.

So many answers here, and no two are alike. \ufffc I have visited the Vatican museums four times. Here are my suggestions which I hope will be helpful.\n1) Skip the advice of people that say \u201cdon\u2019t go in August \u201c! Yes, it is going to be hot and it\u2019s going to be crowded but I assume your trip is already booked and you will still love it!\n2) \ufffc My best bet has always been booking directly with the Vatican Museums website. Be sure to scroll down and click on \u201cmore bookable options\u2019. Anything you book on their site is technically a \u201cskip the line\u201c because you have a timed entry. You will go to the main entrance, show your voucher, then walk into the main lobby area, through security, and pick up your tickets. You can select from a guided tour or a self guided tour. It sounds like you might lean toward the self-guided tour. In that case, you go through the museums at your own pace and arrive at the Sistine chapel on the far end. When you come out of the chapel, you can continue through the museums back to the entrance. You cannot go directly into St. Peter\u2019s basilica, unless you are on a specific outside tour that includes direct entry. That option is not available on the Vatican Museums site.\n3) the only way to avoid some of the heat and crowds in August, would be to book one of the early morning or breakfast tours. These are always highly recommended. Otherwise, any other time of day, the crowds can be overwhelming. Staying with a guide, does give you the advantage of being navigated through some of the most congested areas.\n4) St Peter\u2019s is free to enter from St Peter\ufffc\u2019s Square. Do be aware that the line to enter through security will be daunting. Depending on the time of day and the weather, you might expect to be in line for 2 to 3 hours If you only have a couple of days in Rome, you decide if that is a priority. Also, if you are in Rome, on a Wednesday, the Basilica will be closed in the mornings as pope Francis will be having his public audience in the Square. I can tell you that the basilica IS incredible but there are also many stunning cathedrals and basilicas throughout the city that you can enter at any time without a wait.\n4) if everything is sold out on the Vatican Museums site, there are several good, locally run tour options that might have availability. I highly recommend checking out Katie\u2019s Untold Italy website for recommendations\n, links, and even a discount code or two. I recently booked a private tour for a couple that will be traveling with me in October to see the Vatican and basilica on their 50th anniversary through Liv Tours (via Katie\u2019s link) and the communication has been wonderful.\n5) finally, take all advice with a grain of salt! You do you! Some will say that the Sistine chapel was the highlight of their trip, while others say it is underwhelming. That\u2019s OK!\n\ufffc Wishing you a magical, memorable, and beautiful trip to Italy. You will keep it in your heart forever. \u2764\ufe0f \ufffc"}, {"username": "Jenni Pearl Leavitt", "comment_text": "We booked a breakfast entry at 7:45 without a tour. We were in front of the crowds.
