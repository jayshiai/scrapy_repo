For example the sword fish is delicious there is this dish\n\nhttps://\nricette.gialloza\nfferano.it/\nInvoltini-di-pes\nce-spada.html\n\nthat you realy should try and one more must eat is the famous canolli siciliana made out of fresh sheep ricotta. You can get it in europe.,USA or other parts of italie then sicily but it will NEVER be as good as it is on sicily i can asure you that\n\nAs for going 3 weeks i would realy not stay in one place and travel all the time i would stay in a couple of places for a couple of days.\n\nYou could start in palermo causse there is one of the airports. Palermo Is just like every big city nice for 2/3 days maximum and i would recomend an hotel in mondello(thats the part of palermo at the beach)\n\nhere is a lot to visit one of the nicest things is monreale the cathedral with a golden ceiling. As for local food there is this realy nice and cheap kind of streadfood called\n\nhttps://\nwww.mangiabedda.\ncom/\npanelle-sicilian\n-chickpea.../\n\nthat you should try.\n\nNext if you go to the left is trapanni a smaller realy nice town famous for its tuna fishing.\n\nA nice place to visit is erice a castle on top of the mountain next to trapani its realy not far from palermo so easy do drive there within an hour\n\nNext on the list is agrigento witch is on the south coast. Here you have the\n\nhttps://\nwww.visitsicily.\ninfo/.../\nvalley-of-the-te\nmples/\n\nWitch is lovely to visit there are also nice beaches afcourse so you could stay here couple of days to relax as well\n\nIf we go on you could go away a little from the coast and visit\n\nhttps://\nen.wikipedia.org\n/wiki/Enna\n\nwitch is the highest town in sicily just one or two days is fine.\n\nFrom there you could go to siracusa another coast town with lots of archeological sights.\n\nSicily has been under influence of the vikings, ottomans, byzanthium, romans, greeks etc etc.\n\nFrom there you should go to taormina it is verry touristic but still lovely you can visit the etna from here and take the elevator up to the historic center.

You can go to Sorrento from Pompeii. No need to return back to Naples. If you are only spending the day in Capri, leave on the earliest ferry boat. Crowds from cruise-ships will start at at 8:00 am and leave by 6 pm. Latest ferry leaves just after 7 pm. Book return ticket ahead or you may not get a seat. Consider staying overnight on Capri. It\u2019s a much better vibe at night time once cruisers and daytime crowds leave. From Capri, you can take the ferry boat to Positano. This will save you time. Go to La Tagliata for lunch (high up on the hills from Positano but incredible view and good food and experience). Skip Paestum. Go to Ravello instead and see two main gardens. Ceramic shops are wonderful here. Add one more day on Amalfi Coast. More time needed for beaches, dining, exploring and possibly hiking Path of Gods if you are super fit. Or hire a driver to see Positano, Amalfi, and Ravello all in one day. I\u2019ve done this on a cruise. It\u2019s manageable. But I\u2019ve also stayed in Sorrento and Positano. My choices for over night stays would be Capri and Positano. Sorrento is central but doesn\u2019t feel like Amalfi Coast and technically it isn\u2019t.

If you stay 2 nights somewhere you really only have one full day and that\u2019s not really enough in my opinion. For example Depending on what you want to see in each area even two full days isn\u2019t enough. From sorrento do you want to go to Capri? Amalfi? Positano? Pompeii or Vesuvius? Ravello? \ufffcthe list can get way longer too lol. You will be spending a lot of time in trains and train stations.

I did one Italy trip a few years ago which was Rome, Tuscany and Florence (day trip to several small towns in the area and Sienna) I am going again in April and I am doing Rome (because my son hasn\u2019t seen it) and then 6 nights in Sorrento as my home base and traveling all around that area.

While I loved it, I took too many day tours which with the heat and trying to keep up with the tour guide (my body kept reminding me I\u2019m not 20 anymore or 50 for that matter). I also moved cities too many times (Rome, Naples, Florence, Como, Trieste, and Venice). I am planning to return next spring for 4 weeks - likely mid/late April to early/mid-May. I am focusing on Northern Italy and thinking of staying in 3 or 4 cities and taking trains to neighbouring cities to explore on my own. At the moment I am thinking of Genoa, Bologna, and Udine or Trieste as my base cities. From Genoa, I was thinking of going to Cinque Terre - maybe to walk through all or take a boat trip. I was also thinking about Lucca but think that may be too far to go to and back and have time to explore. That brought up the idea of staying less time in Genoa and staying in Lucca for a few nights on the way to Bologna. And then I think I didn\u2019t see all I wanted in Florence so maybe a few in Florence and go to Lucca from there. Most of the time I would spend in Bologna and take the train to Modena, Parma, Verona and other cities in the area. I missed a lot of what I wanted to see in Trieste so am working out which city to stay in Udine or Trieste. Does this sound reasonable or am I trying to pack too much in again? Does anyone have recommendations for places to stay, possibly B&B or apartments? I am a solo traveller so don\u2019t need a big place and not going to have a car so needs to be somewhat central.

Then I world train to Florence stay as long as you think is enough ( I have lived in Florence & love it) from Florence you can train to Lucca & bus to Siena as the bus drops u right in the city the train u need to catch a taxi back.

But in January the weather in Venice could be very rainy and cold. So I suggest Rome snd Florence. 3 nights Rome, 4 nights Florence. You can fly in and out of Rome. Or fly into Rome and out of Florence. I would start looking at flights now. There should be very good prices as that is the low season. Look on booking sites for hotels. But when you see ones you like, book directly on the hotel website. For Rome I would avoid the area near the train station. Otherwise anywhere city center is good. Hotels I like are Eitch Borromini. A beautiful hotel in an old palace right behind Piazza Navona. Should be a good price in January. Albergo Santa Chiara near the Pantheon. More basic but great location. Comfortable. For Florence near the train station is fine. Anywhere in the city center.
