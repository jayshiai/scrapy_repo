I had read in quite a few places this was no big deal, that most tours are all English speaking people and the guide ends up doing the tour in English or else you can follow closely along with google translate. We didn\u2019t get that lucky. Our group was ALL Italian speaking, she didn\u2019t say one single word to us in English and Google Translate was terrible when it even worked. There was no signal in the underground. My husband and son listened to our downloaded Rick Steves app, but we all feel as though we missed out on so much. I took some amazing pictures and enjoyed just being there, but I would have really enjoyed some history and her point of view.\n\nAlso\u2026.BRING EVERYONES PASSPORT!!!! Despite 2 years of planning and research, I somehow missed this little nugget of information!!! When we went to check in, the man looking at tickets Flat. Out. Refused. To let us in.

Everywhere we went around the lake from Nesso to Varenna, Bellagio to Menaggio is glorious. Try & fit in as much sightseeing as you can.\nHire a boat - we did at Bellagio, cost around \u20ac100 for an hour. Great fun.\nThere are lots of areas around the lake where you can have a dip. Very cold but worth it.\n\nDrive to Venice took around 4hrs & tolls cost us approx \u20ac30. Plenty of services en route & pre-booked car park.\n\nVenice:\nExtremely hot, very very busy but a one off! An experience like nowhere else.\nIf you want to go on the Grand Canal in a gondola be sure to use the gondoliers actually on the Grand Canal. The ones in the small waterways charge the same -\u20ac80 for 20m/half hour or \u20ac120 to make it to the Grand Canal as it\u2019s further.\nHave an Aperol or coffee at Piazza San Marco - most cafes/restaurants there have musicians playing whilst you sit.\nTypical meal at a Trattoria (lasagne, calzone, pizza x 2, a huge beer, medium beer & large bottle of water) for 4 cost us \u20ac90.\n\nAt both Lake Como & Venice we used our card (Starling) everywhere with no problems, and took just a little cash for tips.
