I have been back and forth with both Get your guide and Crown Tours for days now. Here is an overview of what happened.\n\nWe booked our tour on Sunday night for Monday. I didn\u2019t receive the tour confirmation until after our tour had started.\n\nWhen we arrived at our tour, we noticed our group was large, but hey we went with it for the once in a lifetime experience. Our group had 45 people in it.\n\nOur tour guide Elena, commented more than once that the group was too big for her to manage. We received our transmitters and they worked when we had left and started walking over to the Colosseum.\n\nOnce at the Colosseum, we noticed our transmitters going in and out and very staticky. We were right by our guide. She said this was because the group was large. Ok, no big deal. We really couldn\u2019t hear much she was saying. Before we went upstairs, she had asked who needed the elevator. My mother, who had a knee replacement in April stated she needed it. So, she went in with my niece who had mobility issues as well.\n\nThe first time, she waited for my mother. (There\u2019s one elevator that\u2019s small, so it took some time)\n\nNext, she stopped in areas where we couldn\u2019t see anything. We were also picking up other people\u2019s tours on our transmitters (some not in English) At this point, my father, who is also fluent in Italian, asked her if she could speak more into the microphone so we could hear her. She again said, sorry there\u2019s just too many people and seemed annoyed.\n\nAbout 45 minutes into the tour, it was time for another elevator. At this point, she knew my mother would need it again. She did not wait for her to get off, resulting all of us from loosing her and the rest of the group. (We weren\u2019t going to leave my mother behind) We searched all over for her and our group and they were no where to be found.\n\nThis resulting us missing both the Roman forum and the Paletine Hill part of our tour. We were disappointed because we were all really looking forward to this tour. I travel a lot and go on tours to learn more (I am a teacher) but this was truly disappointing. When talking to Crown, they stated that a guide called out sick. If they had contacted us and asked us to move to Tuesday we would have.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that we had to pay for the company\u2019s problem and in result paying for a tour we didn\u2019t go on. The rudeness and not caring about the customers feelings and money was apparent. They are saying they are not refunding us due to the rest \u201cbeing able\u201d to go on the tour, when we couldn\u2019t just leave my mom and my niece behind. And, we attempted to find her and we couldn\u2019t. It seemed as though the guide wanted the tour over before it started.\n\nShe made comments in Italian (we speak it fluently) and was truly unprofessional. We had to walk back to the office after to return the transmitters due to loosing her. We did this as a courtesy. All I am asking is for some respect and acknowledgement that our time was wasted. I feel that we were scammed by this company and their response has been nothing short of rude and disrespectful.\n\nPlease research before you book! I should have known this was too good to be true as the Colosseum is usually booked out.", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2201839130215165/", "likes": 1, "comments": []}, {"id": "2201843603548051", "text": "Can we talk Ziploc bags instead of compression cubes for packing?\n\nI've seen Ziploc bags recommended on this group instead of compression tubes as they work as well.

Looking back I would mix our clothes together in suitcases instead of each of us having our own clothes in each suitcase. Would have made more sense to have packed similar to the way I prepped for the first day. As the trip went on I moved clothes so that all the dirty were consolidated. Seeing as we moved locations 3 times that became more work than it shouldn\u2019t have been. I also packed a lightweight extra bag in one suitcase for anything we might buy. That was full by end of trip. I ended up checking one suitcase on return that had wine and lemon cello in between the clothes.

It was a 19\u2019 boat that was supposed to accommodate 6 guests plus the skipper. It was ROUGH. We ended up only doing one stop because we didn\u2019t want to be on the boat any longer. I truly think the driver was very inexperienced and that was the reason for the unpleasant experience, but that aside\u2026when the boats pull up, prepare yourself for a \u2018bumpy\u2019 exit and entrance. It is very wavy and you really just have to try to time it and cross your fingers. And this is all boats, not just the one we took. We sat and watched for a while and can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t see anyone fall into the water. We did, however, see an older lady who had to be carried off because the ride there was so hard on her. I wouldn\u2019t recommend a boat arrival to anyone elderly.\n\n* So many people say that you can pay with card for anything and that\u2019s just not the case. We traveled the entire country and needed cash for so many things. For example..water taxi to the airport in Venice, private guide to Pompeii through our hired car company, all of the tourist nightly taxes. These were all larger amounts, so yes, keep cash on you.\n\n* Download apps before you arrive if you won\u2019t have cellular service. I didn\u2019t think about this and waited to download some apps but they needed a text code and we only had a data package(taxi apps for Rome, or anything you need to link payment to).\n\n* Yes, it is cheaper to do certain things that you arrange yourself, but sometimes it\u2019s just more practical to let someone else handle the details and planning. I was planning our trip for a year and the transportation part had me so stressed that I postponed the entire thing for another year. I ended up booking some private transfers and it all fell in line. (I live in a small town and public transportation anywhere is so intimidating for me. I know this isn\u2019t an option for some people).\n\nI hope this post doesn\u2019t come off negative. That isn\u2019t my goal. I absolutely LOVED our trip and feel blessed I was able to take it.\n\nPlease add any not commonly talked about points to this post. I see a lot of the same things on all the pages I follow.
