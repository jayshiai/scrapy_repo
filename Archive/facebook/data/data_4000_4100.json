I suspect most tourists here who speak English don\u2019t make the effort highly advise trying your Italian- you\u2019re rewarded with smiles and so much help/ thoughtfulness.\n\n- heat- we\u2019re heading south so expect things to ch age but Milan & Venice not at all challenging . Early am/ evenings are incredibly pleasant, hasn\u2019t been an issue at all which I\u2019m grateful for as I suspect that will change soon\n\n- safety - maybe I\u2019ll eat my words but it feels like any other big city - be smart , don\u2019t display your wealth , leave passports etc at hotel/ appt , crossbody bag with phone / cards. I let my 18 yr old dtr wander / explore on ver own without worry- yes she gets lots of ( male ) attention but it doesn\u2019t feel unsafe\n\n- trains- like all of Europe they make us (North American\u2019s) who lack this infrastructure/ well developed train transport system look foolish. I\u2019d never fly domestic here . ( esp with luggage loss concerns!) Trains are on time safe & efficient. Get premium / business / executive etc with reserved seats if you can at all afford too- worth it! More space to ensure you can store luggage ( be on time get on early if travelling in high season) they give a drink/ snacks in business/ water / simpler snacks in premium. You get the best countryside tours/ views compared to flying , and save the wasted time of getting to airports early, hassles with clearing security etc & arrive in central parts of wherever you\u2019re going\n\nETA-\nLUGGAGE - we have checked & hand luggage -Just couldn\u2019t pare it down more - it certainly would be wayyyy simpler with only hand so for those who are able to simplify better then I it is likely worth it. But honestly if you\u2019re in reasonable shape and the bags aren\u2019t too heavy it hasn\u2019t been an issue - no space concerns on the trains ( remember though we only know premium / business) or the Venetian water taxis\n\n- just use the search feature in this group & search old posts - so much great info!\n\nMILAN\n\n-we came here as it was an easy entry airport as we went to Iceland first. Big city - certainly beautiful, but if time is ltd with all the charm this country has I wouldn\u2019t prioritize it unless you have other reasons. Many posts have all the main points covered , I\u2019d only add:\n\nThe Last supper - absolutely book asap, do the tours if you need to to get a ticket - 3 mos or more prior it sounds like- we saw many disappointed people .\n\nIf you are happy to spend a few extra bucks the Aperol bar on the upper floor of the galleria overlooking the Duomo / square was a great place to enjoy a drink & snacks and just take it all in.\n\nThe Campari bar off the square at the entry to the galleria is also kinda a must do if you enjoy cocktails/ this kinda thing!\n\nWe stayed in the Lombardia area - at least on the weekend super fun nightlife spilling onto the streets- I\u2019m assuming this is one of ( hopefully many) the more LGBTQ friendly areas - which I feel only added to the charm- but if not identifying as such or an ally then maybe you won\u2019t have as much fun as we did.\n\nVENICE -\nI loved that we booked a Vrbo & being on the periphery. It\u2019s dirty with tourists but like most places in the world if you\u2019re willing to walk over a few streets / bridges the rewards are so so worth it! Despite being mid July we\u2019d often be the only ones wandering whatever street we were on, had the best antipasti picnic along a canal we basically had to ourselves . It really only takes 10-20 or more minutes walk to get to the centre from most places . Take a diff route each time!\n\nA bonus of staying in an appt ( vs hotel) is a tiny look into local life - for example I loved learning about how things are done differently due to the obvious- something like the garbage collection process is incredibly charming\n\nWater taxis worked so well , easy to get to Murano etc with it too. As long as you\u2019re not pressed for time no need for rhapeddo.\n\nGondolas- Maybe this is ignorant- but I assume like every professional you get what you pay for. I\u2019m so grateful to whomever here posted their recommendation about Luca! Paid more then the general rate if you go to one of the usual places to catch a tour - but his commentary was so worth it , I\u2019d recommend the longer the better - we did his 75 min tour which takes you to I think 3 diff areas , charming smaller / less busy canals, he\u2019s a 3 rd generation gondolier using his grandfathers boat only one of 19 of the same kind . And yes, he\u2019ll sing to you! For me this level of service was worth paying more for- we saw other gondoliers on their phones, not providing commentary ( only if wanted of course!) , etc .", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2200960283636383/", "likes": 58, "comments": [{"username": "Tracy Foss", "comment_text": "Thanks for the info !

What they are doing is trying to avoid taxes by not declaring all their revenue;\n- if you pay cash be sure to always ask a receipt (RICEVUTA o SCONTRINO) at the end: this will help you find the taxi you used if by accident you forget something inside, to report an inappropriate behaviour and you\u2019ll make sure the taxi driver is paying all the taxes he should pay;\n- the taximeter MUST always be on, there is no exception;\n- taxis are a very strong corporation: in every town there aren\u2019t many taxis because they lobby to prevent the issuance of new licenses (that\u2019s why there are so few Ubers). For italians is even more difficult to catch one than for you as they refuse us because we pay with credit cards, we ask for the taximeter and they can\u2019t rip us too easily. If the price is correct try to take Uber.\nEDIT official taxi fares for Rome https://www.comune.roma.it/web-resources/cms/documents/tariffario_taxi_A.pdf\nEDIT 2 (sorry admins) SOMETIMES (rarely) credit card system doesn\u2019t actually work, usually in the middle of the countryside: if that is the case probably the driver will be very sorry and will be the first to look for a solution. If it ends that you have to pay with cash ask for a scontrino or ricevuta (invoice).", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2200409577024787/", "likes": 221, "comments": [{"username": "Mary Ellen Maatman", "comment_text": "I have to speak up and say we had excellent experiences with taxis throughout our trip.

We've been in Rome for 5 days now and 3 more to go. Then off to the UK for a few days. Here's a few things I've found while here so far.\n1) If your thinking of driving, go for it! Just be ready to drive aggressively. It's actually really easy. Get your international permit first though and give up to a week or two for delivery. Also have plenty of change for parking.\n2) If your looking for a hotel that's luxurious but not too expensive, close to so much food and shopping and 15 min walking to the Capital and the Colosseum. HT6 Botique is the place. The staff is absolutely wonderful and helpful, they have a wonderful breakfast, and a small bar for coffee and/or drinks. There's no elevator for the second floor (there's only two) but the staff will happily carry your luggage up or down for you.\n3) If while your booking your trip and see \"Occidental Aran Park\" hotel....... stay away! The hotel states that their close to everything and have airconditioned rooms. This is absolutely not true! Nuff said!\n4) looking for a small restaurant with an amazing chef (that won't kill the pocketbook) Ristorante Edoardo II is the one! Fresh fish and oysters, absolutely amazing fillet and of course don't forget the pasta. Its a small place with amazing taste!\nSo far, that's what I have for you, I'll add \ufffcmore as we go.
