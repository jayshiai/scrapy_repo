The only part of the trip you could be better off having a car is picking one up on your way to sorrento. This will give you moving ability in almafi. You can use public transport however.\n2. Almost always hotels and bnbs will store your luggage until check in or provide a luggage storage service. No worries here. I do recommend a carry on case plus backpack per traveler. More luggage gets difficult to navigate on trains and through the city. Keep in mind Bnbs often have laundry.\n3.

(two more weeks in Croatia would be divine) Once we hit Italy we spent 15 days there. Started in Trieste then drove to Venice. We love that city and roamed around visiting Murano and Burano this time. (we hit main sights last time) Trained into Milan for the Milan Basilica, The Last Supper and the Sforza Castle. Then on to Florence to roam around. Rented a car for a day trip to see Sienna, San Gimignano, & Vinci then back to Florence as home base. Took the train to Cinque Terre for a couple days, stopped at Pisa on way back to Florence for the iconic picture. Did a cooking class in Florence and we did only one museum that time to see David. (we had less on our agenda this trip) Otherwise we roamed around again because we did the museums last trip there and we fell in love with Florence and just had to go back. From Florence we ended our trip visiting Rome again and saw sights we missed last trip. Did lots of walking and roaming appreciating it at a slower pace. Again, less on the agenda.\nWe can not wait to go back to Italy and visit. We do not regret either itinerary. We want to go back to Italy and visit more of the smaller towns. I would like to venture down to the Almalfi coast this time and surrounding towns there which all sound quaint, beautiful and slower paced. (I know a couple in Almalfi are not due to high tourism there)\nWishing you the best trip no matter how you plan it.\nBut I will say that after doing the 12 day trip verses the 21 day one, I think it is best to go at a slower pace to enjoy your surroundings and just keep in mind that you can alway go back again to see more. This means stick to maybe two countries this time. As other have said you could spend the entire three weeks in Italy and still need more time to see more of the country! I used Google to map out where I wanted to go. I think I would fly into one destination then fly home out of another so not to have to backtrack your travels. Make sure to include travel days (plus check in times to lodging) which all eat up your sightseeing time. This helped it be less stressful and I even added a few days to the trip to accommodate this.

Visit the Uffizi Gallery, the Ponte Vecchio, and the Piazza del Duomo.

Base in Plaka. Fly back to US if only doing 4 weeks.\n\nWeek 5 to 6: Visit any of the Greek islands--stayin\ng a couple nights in each of Santorini, Paros, Milos or Mykonos, etc. Check reviews to see which you may prefer.\n\nWeek 6: Return to Athens and Fly back to the United States from Athens."}, {"username": "Jennifer Reimer Knapp", "comment_text": "We went to Italy then Greece last September.

For example the sword fish is delicious there is this dish\n\nhttps://\nricette.gialloza\nfferano.it/\nInvoltini-di-pes\nce-spada.html\n\nthat you realy should try and one more must eat is the famous canolli siciliana made out of fresh sheep ricotta. You can get it in europe.,USA or other parts of italie then sicily but it will NEVER be as good as it is on sicily i can asure you that\n\nAs for going 3 weeks i would realy not stay in one place and travel all the time i would stay in a couple of places for a couple of days.\n\nYou could start in palermo causse there is one of the airports. Palermo Is just like every big city nice for 2/3 days maximum and i would recomend an hotel in mondello(thats the part of palermo at the beach)\n\nhere is a lot to visit one of the nicest things is monreale the cathedral with a golden ceiling. As for local food there is this realy nice and cheap kind of streadfood called\n\nhttps://\nwww.mangiabedda.\ncom/\npanelle-sicilian\n-chickpea.../\n\nthat you should try.\n\nNext if you go to the left is trapanni a smaller realy nice town famous for its tuna fishing.\n\nA nice place to visit is erice a castle on top of the mountain next to trapani its realy not far from palermo so easy do drive there within an hour\n\nNext on the list is agrigento witch is on the south coast. Here you have the\n\nhttps://\nwww.visitsicily.\ninfo/.../\nvalley-of-the-te\nmples/\n\nWitch is lovely to visit there are also nice beaches afcourse so you could stay here couple of days to relax as well\n\nIf we go on you could go away a little from the coast and visit\n\nhttps://\nen.wikipedia.org\n/wiki/Enna\n\nwitch is the highest town in sicily just one or two days is fine.\n\nFrom there you could go to siracusa another coast town with lots of archeological sights.\n\nSicily has been under influence of the vikings, ottomans, byzanthium, romans, greeks etc etc.\n\nFrom there you should go to taormina it is verry touristic but still lovely you can visit the etna from here and take the elevator up to the historic center.
