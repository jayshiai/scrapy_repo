I went to eat with an American and I paid to repay a favor between us. And what does she do?\n\nDO YOU WANT ME TO GET THE TIP she says.\n\nI said sure.\n\nAlthough I am American by passport, I like how I don't have to tp everywhere. In America, it is forced and waiters and waitresses have been known to get aggressive if you don't tip enough.\n\nUnless they are scammers or beggers, non Americans don't typically feel entitled to American money because they don't need bought.\n\nAnd that is exactly what tipping is. Buying people. Objectifying them as less than you because you ASSUME they make less money than you or their employer hides money from them.\n\nThis is nothing but American projection. Newsflash Americans!!!\n\nThat waitress you see in the rest of the world? They do get paid a living wage. No one is hiding money from them and the employer pays them so you don't have to. That way, you will never hear a waitress loudly announce \"Oh I got a dollar in tip! Now I can pay my rent!\"\n\nThat server you see in the rest of the world? They never are making the choice to eat or pay a doctor because they have healthcare.\n\nDepending on where you are in the world, childrem are looked after so you don't have the \"single mother syndrome\" like you do in the US where a woman has to support one or more kids alone for whatever reason.\n\nThat student? Depending on where he is in the world, his studies might be free or low cost. He is just working for pockrt money. Let that one sink in \"thousands of sollars in debt Americans.\"\n\nRich people use money to appear better and/or cover their problems. One of the ways also is to use money to put down others.\n\nAs for the American I was with the other night, oh yes. She tipped all right. She made the server hold out his hand so she can slowly count the change, slowly putting the coins in his hand one by one.\n\nTipping has become a show off, virtue signaling culture invented by America.\n\nHow embarrassing!"}, {"username": "Glenn Todd Webb", "comment_text": "Service charge is included in the price.

Our guide Simon in Rome who toured the colleseum and Roman forum was also incredibly knowledgeable and kind. Both are contracting through expert tours and travel, nicoletta would be the person to contact for those.\n\nWe also booked a vespa wine tour through Tuscany, and I believe that may have been the highlight of our trip. It was absolutely gorgeous, the guides Santi, Gabi and Stefano were fun and did a great job of splitting the groups by experience so everyone could ride at their own pace.

Because of the heat, 90\u00b0-100\u00b0 took a taxi most of the time. Did walk from our hotel, to the Trivi Fountain and The Spanish Steps. Expect crowds. Did a tour of the Colseum with The Tour Guy. Worth the skip the line and the information was fantastic. At St. Peter\u2019s toured the Necropolis and because we did the tour could skip the line into the Basilica. Amazing tour. The Vatican Scavi Tour. Get reservations early limited to 250 people per day. Small groups (12-16) tour is available in English. Be aware of hot, humid conditions as well as steps and narrow areas.\n\nIn Messina just roamed around the town. Cathedrals everywhere.\nIn Herculaneum did a tour with an archeologist. Fantastic tour.\nSince I had already spent a week in Tuscany a few years ago, I walked around Livorno.

Romantic too! We stopped in Positano, Amalfi, and had a swim stop. Same recommendation for a trip to capri. Stay off the big ferry and go with a smaller company for the ambience if nothing else!

We caught the early bus (#5070) from Sorrento , took around 35-40 minutes, very scenic drive . As for crowds it was crazy busy and super hot which did not make it super enjoyable sorry to say . By taking the bus it lets you off up the top (2nd stop - Sponda is name of stop) on the main road then you get to walk down the hill through all the small roads and alley ways of shops , cafes and restaurants. Some very nice shops . Made our way to the beach and had a very nice swim to cool us down . Found a nice spot for lunch then we caught the ferry back to Sorrento . Nice way to do this as a day trip from Sorrento. I must say, Sorrento is so much more relaxing than Positano.
