I posed the same questions in various forums and of course everyone has their favorite. With all the recommendations\n, I looked for a consensus on particular restaurants and \ufffcwrote those down, and here is what I learned. Restaurants have bad days. There were several restaurants that were highly recommended by a majority only for it to be not so great, It could be a server who has a bad attitude or the chef or main cook is off that day or maybe I ordered the wrong item. Honestly, it was like a 50-50 split based on the recommendations\n. Conclusion, recommendations\nare good including the review-based apps, one of the things that I do that kind of narrows down the possibility of a bad meal or experience is I usually go to these review apps, click on the latest reviews and look for the last 5 to 10 reviews to see if I notice a negative trend , if you see things mentioned like bad attitude, bad service, the food was just OK I would eliminate those. I did have a lot of luck of just walking down side streets, finding a hole in the wall and having a delicious meal and then recommending that same restaurant to friends for them to have a bad meal lol!

Learn to say can I have a table for 2. Where is the bathroom. Can I have the bill please. Can I have another (glass of wine). A little Italian goes a long way. Trust me. Also use the Google translate camera app to translate the menu into English.\nLastly, avoid any restaurant that has pictures of the food outside the restaurant and or on the menu.\nAvoid Amalfi.

I\u2019ve been traveling to Rome on those overnight flights from CA and the east coast for years, and I have had success with the both the hit-the-ground-\nrunning / early dinner / early-ish bedtime approach as well as the afternoon-nap / early evening stroll / normal Roman dinner time approach. It also depends on how much time you will have in Rome overall, which kind of dictates how okay you are going to feel about not having something in place that first day. I personally think golf cart tours in Rome or anywhere are a really good way to get an overview and orientation without having to think about anything or deal with reading a map. Anyway you slice it, you *will* be tired that first day and the less you have to get your brain in gear to be in charge of leading the family around, the better it will be! My advice is to let someone else take the wheel\u2014book the golf cart tour for 7:30 and grab a nap and shower at the hotel in the blazing hot afternoon. Gives you some wiggle room too vs the 3pm in case the flight is delayed. I would definitely make sure the tour can include some stops for pizza and gelato as we all know keeping the kids (and yourselves) fed will be key to everyone\u2019s success! Then, to bed, and you\u2019ll be in good shape adjusting to the time change.

We\u2019ve booked our trip next year to do a honeymoon redo \ud83d\ude02\n-Hotel Loreli for sunset drinks- WOW\n-There\u2019s also a cute little land train that takes you around sorrento, down to the front etc & that was lovely, you get earphones to hear the history of places as well which was great. It runs all day up to 11pm. We did it 6.30 before drinks & dinner & we had it to ourselves. This was \u20ac7.50!\n- Shopping streets & Piazza Tasso are just so pretty. Well it all is.\n- Unfortunately because our trip was cut short in sorrento & was stressful etc with hospitals & his arm & the potential for surgery we couldn\u2019t fully appreciate everything or immerse ourselves into the food so I don\u2019t have restaurant recommendations\nas we only had two dinners & a lunch & to be honest that\u2019s a blur \ud83d\ude02"}, {"username": "Rochelle Donaldson", "comment_text": "Tamara Pitt this is so overwhelming"}, {"username": "Taran Whitburn-Cassin", "comment_text": "Spend as little time in Rome as possible.

Be aware that the terminology used online is often inconsistent and confusing.\nMany electronics like phones, iPads and laptops are already dual voltage (check the label on the back, it should say something like 110 - 240 V). For these, you only need an adaptor which \u201cadapts\u201d the plug to the shape of the wall outlet.\nIf your appliance is not dual voltage, you will need both an adaptor and a converter. A converter \u201cconverts\u201d the voltage coming from the wall (220V) to the voltage (120V) needed by your appliance. If you don\u2019t use a converter, you will trip a breaker, burn up your appliance and/or start a fire.\nThe problem for travelers is that most appliances with motors or that heat need a lot of power (watts), and the converters needed are very heavy.\nThe best thing to do is buy a dual voltage appliance and then only an adaptor (specific to country or area) is needed wherever you travel.\nAnother option would be to buy a 220V version in Europe.\nIf, however, you want to try a converter, check that label again for the wattage and make sure that the converter is adequate for the wattage of your appliance."}, {"username": "Carey Mundy", "comment_text": "I bought a European one ona trip and use it!
