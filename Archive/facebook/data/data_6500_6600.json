Bus stop is less than a minute away on foot which drops at the metro in front of stadium. Metro and bus are now \"ticketless\". Meaning if you get on the bus first, tap/swipe your credit card. That card acts as your ticket. It's good for 90 mins. Within those 90 mins, if you get on the metro tap/swipe that same card. It's all connected, so it reads that you're within your time, and the gate opens. Very easy vs smaller towns like mine where you have to still go to the tabaccheria to buy tickets.\n\nAlso, download citymapper app. Will give you all your options to your destination (bus, metro, taxi, etc) and The time/cost difference.

Want to know that the BIGGEST reason she never go to go? MANY, many many of the bathrooms were located - DOWNSTAIRS. The subways were downstairs (many without elevators and/or escalators). The doorways getting in/out of hotel restrooms - way too small for her walker - and if we could get her walker in there - there wasn't enough room to maneuver - if you get my drift. She was not strong enough to get up/down stairs of tour buses.
