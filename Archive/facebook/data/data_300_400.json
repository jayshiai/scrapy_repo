I can't thank this group enough for all of the indispensable tips in helping plan the vacation of a lifetime. The best I can do is give something back here for anyone who is going to this beautiful country.\n\n-ITINERARY: We spread our vacation out starting in Rome, then to Florence and finally to Venice. All travel was by train between these areas through TrenItalia business class. Best advice I can give here is book your tickets in advance on the app! We mixed into these hub locations several excursions and private tours. 2 travel days, 4 days in Rome, 4 days in Florence, 2 days in Venice. Make sure to schedule downtime with nothing booked (I can't emphasize this enough). We made sure to do this and were still able to cover a lot. There is a saying in Italy that you can see Italy or experience Italy - you have to experience it! Walk around with no plans, pop into a cafe, speak with the locals and brush up on your Italian.\n\n-TOURING: We did several tours through LivTours and their services were top notch as they are family owned. Their guides took us on our tours through the Colosseum, skip the line at the Vatican/St. Peter's Basilica/Sistine as well as a private day trip to Pompeii and Amalfi Coast (Sorrento and surrounding towns). We even used them on a walking tour in Florence which was a lot of fun. Every single one of their guides was great with keeping our young boys engaged (pre-teen age) and had a passion for the story telling on the tour as an art historian or native of the region. These were some of the best memories on our trip, because without understanding the history at these sites you will be missing out. I highly recommend LivTours and would definitely use them again. In addition, we did a day trip to Tuscany when we stayed in Florence through Walks which was also fantastic with a great lunch/winery tour. It's so hard to choose the highlights as they were all amazing!\n\n-CLOTHES: No one cares what you are wearing -- comfort first, fashion second. There was a mix of everything under the sun on our trip and each city was FILLED with tourists lugging backpacks and suitcases. You do you!\n\n-PACKING: After all the stories I read here about not checking bags and packing light - we did a mix of both and were just fine. We checked 2 bags (a carry on and one big suitcase) and carried backpacks between the 4 of us for all essentials and were just fine. Use air tags and be practical about what you are willing to part with in case things get lost. Take direct flights as much as possible to avoid shuffles. I will note that we ultimately chose to check at least 2 bags as we have young children and it didn't make sense to go overseas without peace of mind that we would have enough with us for the duration of our trip. Pro tip: There is a very cheap laundry service in Florence and after a week plus of traveling we opted to just do a load of dirty clothes there that was life saver. The prices were more then reasonable.\n\n-PASSPORTS: Keep a copy on your phone, there is no need to carry these out unless you are going several hours away from your hotel. We were not asked once to show these when we were walking around. The hotel safe is the best place to keep them and make sure you are going to a reputable chain. Almost every hotel scanned our passports (we stayed exclusively at Marriotts) so someone will always have a copy aside from you, it's fairly routine.\n\n-SAFETY/PICKPOCKETING/SCAMS: Every single Italian we met was welcoming and I never felt unsafe in any location. My husband and I have both lived internationally in a few countries so we have more experience than most in international travel -- you just need to stay aware of your environment. Keep your bags on you and visible at all times. Learn to ignore anyone approaching you to sell something or put it in your hand, keep it moving. Also tourist traps will try to get every single Euro out of you and more, so be wary of heavily toured areas or businesses adding on charges. Bathrooms also require payment in public areas, so keep some loose change on you for those. We did not have issues with pickpockets or anything of that nature on this trip, thank goodness.\n\n-PHOTOS: I can't recommend Stas Varych enough - we used his services in Rome for our family shoot (photo for reference sans our boys) and he was AMAZING! He worked with us even when the weather was not working with us (it rained and then there was sunshine) and was super flexible in arranging our shots across different days. They came out beautiful and definitely helped us capture the memories.\n\n-THE HEAT: We lucked out during our stay - the weather was in the 80-90s F and the cloudy days helped a lot with the sun factor. I brought a ton of sunscreen along and only used it once during our entire trip! It even rained in Rome one day which provided some much needed relief from the humidity. Make sure you are hydrating constantly - there are also a ton of fountains everywhere to refill water so definitely take advantage of those. The fountain water is fine and tasty! Find lots of shade where you can and eat your weight in gelato, you won't regret it. Many folks you see will be using them across town throughout the day in heavily toured areas.\n\n-THE WALKING/STEPS: WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES. I was in my Hokas most of the trip along with a backup pair of New Balances and they were fine throughout hiking, touring etc. We logged what felt like a million steps during our trip and all 4 of us were fine. Cobblestone is everywhere so when you are walking make sure you aren't tripping into gaps in the stone. Your small luggage should also be able to roll on streets without issue.\n\n-THE BOTTOM LINE: Vacation of a lifetime! The food was off the charts good. My kids love seafood and there was plenty of octopus, mussels and clams on almost every menu. We even had Indian food in Florence which was great, so if you want a variety it is there. The Fork app isn't the best but did the trick for us when finding food in a pinch. We did make some reservations in advance to ensure we could go to the busier restaurants during summer that were off the beaten path.\n\nAll in all, Italy is a beautiful country with a rich history and culture and the most welcoming people. We had a fantastic time and will definitely be going back again!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2212985895767155/", "likes": 509, "comments": [{"username": "Debbi Mayfield", "comment_text": "So glad to hear about Liv Tours!!

The stop you want to go to is \"Tivoli,\" not \"Bagni Tivoli\" which is where I got off (based on what people on the train told me). It is about an hour walk rom Tivoli. Luckily, there was a bus that went to Tivoli. 2) You can enter St.Peter's Basilica directly from the Vatican museum, which I didn't know! Will save a ton of time because the lines to St.Peter's are really long most of the day. 3) I stayed in Trastevere and the restaurants are very crowded. You can get in pretty easily between 7:00 and 8:00 if you sit inside. Outside waits at some of the more popular restaurants were two hours! 4) The ferries at Lake Como were crazy crowded and hectic.
