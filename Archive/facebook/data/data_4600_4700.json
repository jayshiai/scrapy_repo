Thought I\u2019d share a relatively unknown event that is truly unique and I can\u2019t recommend enough.\nCarnival, the days leading up to the Lenten season, is celebrated across Italy with each city having its own traditions. In the smaller town of Ivrea in Piemonte, Carnival means the Battles of The Oranges. A tradition set around the tale of a tyrant baron in the 13th century, he declared his right to jus primae noctis on the miller\u2019s daughter, the Mugnaia. Once taken to the castle, however, the Mugnaia beheaded the baron and set off a revolt of the townspeople against the baron\u2019s men.\nToday, for 3 days the townspeople, divided up into 9 groups of Aranceri (basically krewes for those familiar with Mardi Gras), battle \u201cthe baron\u2019s men\u201d who parade through the town in horse-drawn carts. The weapons for the battle: oranges. There\u2019s a ton of other tradition and ceremony involved but I won\u2019t make the post longer explaining it all, but highly recommend for a truly once in a lifetime experience.\n\nAs for logistics, Ivrea is an hour north of Turin by direct train. Naturally places to stay in town sell out far in advance, I stayed in Turin and just took the train each day. Ivrea itself is a beautiful town with history as a city going back to ancient Rome, though you\u2019ll want to go before the madness of the celebrations to enjoy the city and its sites.

My poor mom back at home in NJ was trying to talk to verizon at all hours of the day and night to try to get them to fix the issues. We thought we had it solved... but it wasn't until I was on the train to La Spezia that I realized it wasn't fixed, my phone had only been working because of wifi. So I got to cinque terre still without service. I got to the airbnb (more on that in a second) and basically stayed there for SIX HOURS on the phone with verizon because if I left, I wouldn't have wifi and thus no way to talk to them. Eventually the representative told me there was nothing else they could do for me and that they'd elevate it to the next department... which would get back to me in 10-15 days \ud83d\ude11\n\nI may or may not have told the lady if I end up on the back of a milk carton, it would be her conscious.\n\nANYWHO.... \ud83d\ude05\n\nFrom La Spezia, getting the train to Cinque Terre was super easy. You can buy they train/trail pass online and avoid the line at the station.\n\nI prearranged with my airbnb host they he would meet me at the train station and he did. He walked me to the airbnb which was relatively easy to find (Riomaggiore by the marina). When we got there a lady from a unit above mine came up to me. She and her husband only spoke English and they couldn't get their stove to work... and the instructions were only in Italian. My airbnb host only spoke minimal English so as a group we all went up to their unit and I played translator between everyone (thank you duolingo) and eventually we figured out the stove situation.\n\nThe airbnb had a stunning view. It was perfect for just me. It COULD host six people (bunk beds) but I think it would be a little crammed.\n\nDuring my days in cinque terre, I spent time in each town. I think Riomaggiore was the perfect place for me to stay but I also enjoyed really Manarola. I spent one of my afternoons there swimming and jumping off the rocks.\n\nI also did the pesto making class at Nessun Dorma. It's the only food class I did during my trip because I kind of have it in my head that cooking classes are more fun with a plus 1. With that said, this was a great class. Very fun. I was a little bitter that everyone else got to trade off with their partners/group when it came time to beating the basil leaves... whereas I had to do it the whole time (it's exhausting lol). But the experience was definitely worth it. The owner has so much personality. We got to chatting about my trip and he ended up gifting me a free t-shirt.\n\nI also did a sunset boat tour... which I was lowkey disappointed in. The people on the tour were all very nice and friendly. But the guide assured me that swimming would be a big part of it and that I should run back up to my airbnb to change into a bathing suit (I arrived in a dress, but the meeting point was just outside my airbnb). I changed, we set off... and it was like pulling teeth to get anyone to swim. And it was basically a quick dip before we got back on the boat. Also I don't have many pictures from the boat because I had to leave my phone tucked away to avoid it getting wet. Everyone who had to sit at the front of the boat got drenched from the waves. Would I do another sunset tour? Yeah probably, but I'd consider a different company.\n\nI didn't get a chance to do the hiking trails becuase I didn't have enough room to pack the appropriate footwear. (Just another excuse to go back and visit again!)\n\nOh and one last personal note from this trip, at one point I stopped in a restaurant while they were setting up to ask a quick question. I got to talking to a waiter and he was super kind. Fast forward several hours later and I walked past the restaurant and all of a sudden I hear \"Kristen Amore!\" I looked around and the waiter had called out (causing multiple people to look at him and thus me) and held up heart hands \ud83d\ude05 it was very cute. We never hung out though cause I was leaving the next day.\n\nI'm probably missing a lot of things.

Highly recommend to purchase tickets in advance and pack light (carry on only and a back pack) if you do June. Since you travel with your kids and parents it\u2019s best to slow down and enjoy the surroundings instead of rushing from one tourist spot to another. It seems close distance but still take half a day to travel from place to place, and think about the unthinkable like train rescheduling , or cancellation. Florence and Venice for me have to be 2 days each at least.

I couldn\u2019t have planned the trip without the online groups. I was so glad to visit the country that my grandfather came from when he was 12.\n\nI\u2019m going to break up my posts per city and start with Venice.\n\nWe went to London first and flew from London to Venice via British Airways. We all used one small carry on and a backpack.\n\nDay 1 Venice\n\nPickup by VQ Travels water taxi to hotel which was absolutely amazing! What a great company to work with for travel arrangements! It was the most spectacular entrance to Venice and Italy via a private water taxi.\n\nWe checked into All Angelo Art Hotel, but our rooms weren\u2019t ready so we got lunch around the corner at Rossopomodoro. We all got pizza, and it was amazing!\n\nAfter our lunch we walked around a little and headed back to the hotel, our rooms were ready and we all took naps.\n\nWe loved our hotel and rooms. We had a beautiful canal view for each of our rooms. We had 2 rooms for our family of 5.\n\nWe went to a little place right around the corner from our hotel for Apertivo and had some snacks and Aperol Spritzes.\n\nWe went to dinner at Ai Due Viscovi-it was okay, not our best meal but decent service and good pasta. We walked around and stopped at a few places on our walk back and discovered at the one the amazing Hugo Spritz! Those are amazing.\n\nDay 2 Venice\n\nWe went for a Gondola ride after breakfast-just grabbed the one beside our hotel canal 80 Euro for 5 people 30 min. I\u2019m glad we did it since I had heard mixed reviews.\n\nWe walked around and got lost in the streets of Venice. We ate chicchetti for lunch no reservation-just walked up. Some of the smaller stores didn\u2019t take credit cards in Venice, so make sure you have Euros. I had read everyone took credit cards here and there and that\u2019s absolutely not true.\n\nWe had dinner but I can\u2019t remember the name! We didn\u2019t have a reservation. It was good but service slow.\n\nWe walked up to a little restaurant in San Marco for tiramasu. loved the service and staff. Excellent dessert!\n\nWe went to our St Mark\u2019s Evening Tour with Walks and Devour tours. Really well done and informative tour!\n\nThen got some drinks at the cafe next to St Mark\u2019s and went to listen to the music in the piazza.\n\nDay 3 Venice\n\nAfter our hotel breakfast we had our pickup from VQ Travel in water taxi to train to Florence.\n\nWe loved All Angelo Art Hotel. Perfect location. Everyone was so kind, clean rooms, amazing breakfast, beautiful view!\n\nOur first experience with the train was not as difficult as I had feared. Booking through the Trenitalia app was great because I could see our train number and platform before it was even posted on the board. The business class seats were really comfortable. I watched a few You Tube videos and read everyone\u2019s posts in here and had no issues.\n\nI will have a separate post for Florence, Capri, and Rome!", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2199108103821601/", "likes": 98, "comments": [{"username": "Lori Sammons", "comment_text": "We are heading in Venice end of this month flying from Rome, my hotel quote me a bit high can you share your company that pick you up?
