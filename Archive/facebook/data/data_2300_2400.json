Corniglia is the only village in Cinque Terre that is not located on the coast, but rather on a hilltop.

From there, you can take a local train to the Corniglia train station. The train ride is only about 5 minutes, but it is important to note that there are only a few trains per day that stop at Corniglia.\n\nIf you are not up for the climb, there is a shuttle bus that runs from the train station to the village center. The shuttle bus costs \u20ac1.50 per person, and it runs every 10-15 minutes.\n\nHere are some other things to keep in mind if you are planning on visiting Corniglia:\n\n* The village is very small, so it is easy to get around on foot.\n* There are no cars allowed in the village, so you will need to walk or take the shuttle bus to get around.\n* There are a few restaurants and shops in the village, but it is not a large tourist destination, so there are not as many options as in the other villages of Cinque Terre.\n* The views from the village are amazing, so be sure to take your time and enjoy them!"}, {"username": "AnaMaria Uceda", "comment_text": "From the five towns, that\u2019s Corniglia.
