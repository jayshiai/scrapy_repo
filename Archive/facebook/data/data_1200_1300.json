Very happy to see you have chosen also Sicily, in particular Cefal\u00fa which is lovely! Don't forget to visit the old Lavatoio (where people washed clothes) and the narrow streets! A tip on your way to Cefal\u00fa :stop for a bath in Torre Conca, Finale di Pollina which is a wonderful place.

Along the way, once you get off the autostrada at Vibo/Pizzo, the towns of Vibo, Pizzo, Zambrone, Briatico, and Parghelia have so much to offer before you get to Tropea and surrounding towns of Capo Vaticano, and S. Domenica. So much history here too. I've been to Italy 17 times (from Australia) and experienced the north but the south has so much to offer that people tend to miss it completely."}, {"username": "Nancy Matheny", "comment_text": "We are staying at Terra Antica in Montepulciano.
