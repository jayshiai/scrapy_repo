Not everyone has the same opportunities nor have they had the exposure to other cultures to know and understand local customs.\n\nIL COPERTO (the COVER charge - for tablecloth & bread) is charged when you sit at a table for lunch or dinner. It\u2019s charged whether you have a tablecloth or not or whether you eat the bread. It\u2019s not uncommon in many European countries. You\u2019ll find this in France, Greece, Spain etc\n\nL\u2019APERITIVO (HAPPY HOUR is the closest English translation) is a long held Italian tradition in the daily unwind from the work day in Italy during the hours of about 4-8pm before dinner. When you order a drink, food that is supplied is completely free of charge. This is a waste not way of living. Food that is not sold at \u201cil bar\u201d during the day is provided free to patrons towards evening so it isn\u2019t wasted. It\u2019s a time to gather with friends and socialise. You will be provided usually with \u201cstuzzichini\u201d, small snacks or bites of food.\n\nL\u2019APERICENA is similar to the aperitivo and sometimes people use it interchangeably\n. The quantity and type of food is greater and usually you are charged for this.
