My husband and I (in our 50's), along with our 2 sons (21 and 18) spent 11 very full days in Italy. We flew from Canada direct to Frankfurt, Germany then got on a train to Zermatt, Switzerland where we spent 1 night. It was a quaint little town with a cog train to take you to the Matterhorn! AMAZING!\nFrom there we traveled by fast train, trenitalia, through Italy. When booking our trip, I wanted hotels that were in the town centers so we could immerse ourselves in Italian culture and walk or hop on a bus, metro or cab to get around. We didn't want fancy or pools or anything like that. Just clean, authentic, air conditioned, great location. In Rome we stayed in a former monastery called Casa Cappuccini. It was VERY plain but clean, great location. We had a family room with 1 queen bed and 2 twin beds. AC worked great and it had an elevator, very friendly staff, no breakfast included but a restaurant right across the street. It was also steps away from a taxi stand, the metro train and the hop on hop off bus stop. And only a walk to lots of restaurants, trevi fountain. If you want fancy, this is not for you but for us it was perfect and we would stay again.\nNext, we went to Sorrento and stayed at Hotel del Corso. This hotel was in the center of town and a short walk from the train station, the town square, lots of shops and restaurants, and the marina where you can pay to go to a beach club or catch a ferry or boat to other destinations. This hotel was also very old but clean, had an elevator and AC. We loved the authentic Italian feel, the owners were super kind, helpful and friendly and buffet style breakfast was included. There was a washer and dryer on site as well that you could pay to use which I did as it was near the end of our trip! This hotel had a beautiful terrace overlooking the street and town Square. Bfast was served here. At this hotel we opted for 2 rooms, one with a queen bed and one with 2 twins. Both very clean. I hope this post will help someone looking for a similar experience. Our goal was to really experience Italy, the history, the food, the people, the charm and everything that makes it so different from modern North America.\nIf you are looking for modern or to spend a lot of time at your hotel, these options are probably not for you. I hope you love Italy as much as we did! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9", "link": "facebook.com/groups/1373361046396315/permalink/2204491479949930/", "likes": 203, "comments": [{"username": "Dana Talusani", "comment_text": "Very helpful stuff!

The benefit of using this airport is there are never usually long wait times for airport security or passport control (only 2 destinations outside the Schengen zone)."}, {"username": "Alessandro Iannelli", "comment_text": "You can get to Stansted from london with a coach, they are fairly comfortable. Personally, I don't see a specific reason why one would necessarily want to travel from Heathrow or Gatwick. If anything, I prefer Stansted because it is smaller. Also, on a side note, it used to be easier to travel from and to the u.k., now you need a passport and it's a lot of work to get one, at least in Italy."}]}, {"id": "2204436206622124", "text": "Come explore Spello, one of Umbria\u2019s most enchanting places!

Pack light. If you think you packed light, pack even lighter. Wash and reuse and/or buy there (yes they have everything you need).\n\n2. Pack clothes that dry easily. Dryers are not common. If needed ask hotel/Airbnb for paid laundry service.\n\n3. The main tourist places speak English but a small gesture of Italian helps with a good experience for all. I found that my Spanish (very similar to Italian) got me pretty far.\n\n4. Uber app is available in most places but difficult to confirm a driver. The metro (subway) is great. Taxis work well here and lots have bike/e-bike/scooter options. If you\u2019re going somewhere far I\u2019d suggest to prebook a driver.\n\n5.

According to the visual directions, the top of the bottle is to be cut off and turned upside down, with the drinking hole now facing down inside the bottle. The yeast and brown sugar is added to the small amount of water in the bottle. The mixture of sugar and yeast produces carbon dioxide which emits from the bottle, attracting mosquitoes. Once the mosquitoes go into the bottle, they suffocate and die. For the trap to be effective, the inventors added that the mixture must be replaced every two weeks.\n\nCreated en masse, this DIY mosquito trap would be rather effective, reducing the mosquitoes that carry dengue virus, West Nile or any other mosquito-borne illness. It was an invention designed by a teen who won a national scholarship about ten years ago . I\u2019ve been using it since .

Everywhere you go inside the old city walls built centuries ago to protect the city\u2019s citizens, houses, roads and churches are lovingly restored with great respect for the past. Montone belongs to Perugia province of Umbria, also called Italy\u2019s green heart.\nThe city is believed to originate from the 10th century, and has throughout the time been subject to both small and large tyrants \u2013 as so many of Italy\u2019s cities have been. We have known\nMontone since our first visit to Umbria almost 15 years ago, and from the outset we fell in love with the cobbled streets and balconies draped with colorful flowers that flow in line with the coarse streets that seem to go more than down. 6 years ago we decided to move to this beautiful town with our 3 kids. And we are still loving it.... Montone is located on top of a hill of 482 meters above sea level (40 km from Perugia, 140 km from Florence and about 240 km from Rome), overlooking the confluence between the two rivers Tiber and Carpina.\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9Lots of events are going on trough the year In the summer we have tjhe Umbria Film Festival and our palio Donazione della Santa Spina.
