There are two planned strikes for when we will be in Italy. One is a rail strike that affects Italo, nation-wide. Naturally, we are scheduled to travel that day. The other is air traffic controllers, nation-wide.\n\nThe rail strike is scheduled for September 17-18, beginning at 3:00 AM on the 17th until 2:00 AM on the 18th, so 23 hours. We will be traveling at 8:30 AM on the 18th. Does this mean the trains will be backed up? How do we find out if our train will go that day at all if they are backed up?\n\nThe second strike is for what I think is air traffic controllers on September 16 from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, although I don't think this one will affect us (but not positive) as we land at 11:30 AM on September 17. In this case, do planes just not take off from or for Italy that would be landing during the time period of the strike since there is no traffic control? I'll assume it will back up traffic for a day or two?\n\nWe don't typically experience this level of strikes in the US with such regularity, so I'm not sure of how stikes like these work or affect travel, locally and nationally. BTW, there are a LOT of planned strikes for local transportation all over Italy for September. You may want to check the strike calendar, just be sure you have Google translate on so you can read it properly--put in dates that would affect you.

Here are a few options:\n\nBologna: This is the closest airport to Asiago, and it is also the most affordable option. You can take a train from Bologna Centrale station to Asiago. The journey takes about 2 hours.\n\nVerona: This airport is a bit further from Asiago than Bologna, but it has more flight options. You can take a train from Verona Porta Nuova station to Asiago. The journey takes about 2.5 hours.\n\nVenice: This airport is the furthest from Asiago, but it is also the most popular tourist destination in Italy. You can take a train from Venice Santa Lucia station to Asiago. The journey takes about 3 hours.\n\nMilan: This airport is also a popular tourist destination, but it is not as close to Asiago as Bologna or Verona. You can take a train from Milan Centrale station to Asiago. The journey takes about 3.5 hours.\n\nIf you are looking for a route with some nice points of interest to stop along the way, I would recommend flying into Bologna and taking the train to Asiago. You can stop in the town of Vicenza, which is known for its beautiful architecture.\n\nYou can also stop in the town of Marostica, which is known for its annual chess tournament that is played in the streets.\n\nIf you are flying into Verona, you can stop in the town of Verona, which is home to the famous Verona Arena.\n\nIf you are flying into Venice, you can stop in the city of Venice itself, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

I was so looking forward to going to this country with my two kids and husband .\n\nWe were all ready , packed and with only 4 hours left for the flight my son started having severe stomach pain. Rushed him to the ER , he had to have appendix surgery and we came home 2 days later .\nMissed the flight , all but one airbnbs returned 50% . All of the attraction tickets I bought through official websites do not have any cancellation option so I will have to start calling them tomorrow . Only cancellation that happened was via Viator .\nI don\u2019t know how to feel. I am extremely relieved that my son didn\u2019t get sick in the air or in Italy but I am so extremely lost now with what to do next.\nBought my plane tickets through a third party and they are of no help when I tried to reschedule. I am constantly on the phone . As of now they are saying don\u2019t be hopeful on the air ticket refund. I will keep trying .\nHad so much fun planning this trip.. this group was nothing but wonderful. Just wanted to share my story here .please keep my family in your prayers .",

The night before we were scheduled to come home, my son got the flu and had a fever of 104. There was no way he was getting on a plane. We took him to a hospital and they said he couldn\u2019t fly for five days. There was no charge at the hospital and they gave us a note that he couldn\u2019t fly. I called the airlines right away to cancel our flight and see if they could get us on another one. The trouble was it was the week between Christmas and New Years and all the planes were full! Finally they got us on one New Years Eve but had to bump us up to business class because all the other seats were filled. When I got home I contacted our travel insurance company and they were great! They covered the balance on our airfare and even asked if I had receipts for the extra nights for rooms and food! We stayed with friends so we didn\u2019t have any extra expenses but they were ready to cover those too!"

I can imagine how disappointed you are.\n\nBut as someone who was involved in a life threatening accident in Rome that required hospitalization\nand surgery I have to say I\u2019m glad his problem\nhappened here instead of in Italy. To be honest, I received excellent medical care there and they saved my life. But it\u2019s very frightening and psychologically\ndifficult to deal with a medical system you\u2019re unfamiliar with. And where you maybe aren\u2019t fluent with the language. (I can say some common phrases in Italian but medical terms were beyond me.). Then there\u2019s the financial aspect. Before leaving the first hospital I had to pay 24 thousand Euros for my stay of three days plus surgery. The second hospitalization\nwhich lasted two full weeks was additional. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how stressful it would have been to face those worries in a foreign country on top of concerns for your sons health.\n\nOn the bright side, as I said before, I was treated very well by the doctors and hospital staff. All of my hotels were extremely cooperative and refunded my non refundable payments in full. I hadn\u2019t expected that but was certainly happy they did it. I had purchased flight insurance which covered my missed flight back home. I was also lucky in that my home medical insurance reimbursed me in full for the amount I had to pay the Italian hospitals. And my insurance also paid for a first class flight ticket to get me home as well as paid for a nurse to accompany me.\n\nSo although you were unlucky with what happened, in another way you were lucky it happened before your trip not while you were on it.\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned from my own experience.\n1. Buy medical insurance for each trip. Most US policies do not provide for the reimbursement mine did. But you do need to have coverage while abroad.\n2. Buy flight insurance. It\u2019s cheap\nbut so important if something happens.\n3. Be sure any insurance you have provides for evacuation home.\n4. Always book directly with the provider (the airline or the hotel itself, for example) because the third party is just another layer of bureaucracy you have to deal with if something goes wrong.\n5. Stay in a fully staffed hotel not a vacation rental. The help provided by the hotel staff was invaluable to me. From going with me in an ambulance, to making arrangements to extend my husband\u2019s longer than intended stay at reduced rates, to making phone calls for us I honestly can\u2019t imagine how we\u2019d have navigated the situation without their kindness and help. They did so many things, both little and big, to help\nus out during our nightmare. I\u2019ll be forever grateful to all of them.\n6. Take along an extra high limit credit card to be used only in case of an emergency.\n\nNone of this will help you right now. But I wanted you to know you\u2019re not alone in having had a trip ruined by medical issues. I\u2019m proof that anything can happen so I hope passing on what I learned might somehow help to prevent struggles in the future.\n\nAnd of course, I hope your son is fine and healthy now. That\u2019s really the most important thing."

My thought is that the many travel vendors aren\u2019t as forgiving or generous with refunds due to the fact that they\u2019re trying to recoup income lost during the pandemic. If they\u2019re unwilling to do a refund, ask for a credit to use within a certain timeframe. Airline tickets probably won\u2019t refund, but again, you can try the credit route. It might be helpful to get a doctors note that your son had to have emergency surgery at the last minute. Best to you."

We were lucky in that most of the excursions I pre-paid, we got refunds for. The ones I hadn't prepaid - hotel etc - I just cancelled with no penalty. We got 80% of our rail tickets back. We didn't get refunds for some of the smaller airlines but got a letter from them saying we were \"no-shows\" - which we provided in our insurance claims. My sister had bought cancellation/\ninterruption insurance and she just got all her money back. I filed an insurance claim with my credit card and am still waiting but I'm sure it'll come through. Definitely get a letter from your son's doctor, outlining his illness and that he was unable to travel. Hopefully the companies will refund you - or at least provide a credit for what you have paid. I hope you can reschedule your dream trip and it will be even more wonderful. We are already planning a re-do for next year."

The fountain is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rome, and it is always crowded, even in the off-season. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel with access to public transportation,\nI would recommend staying in a hotel in a less crowded area, such as Trastevere or the Monti neighborhood.\n\nAnd also yes, queen and king size beds are not as common in Europe as they are in the United States. The standard bed size in Europe is a double bed, which is about the size of a twin bed in the United States. However, there are some hotels that do offer queen and king size beds, but they may be more expensive.\n\nHere are some reasonably priced hotels in Rome with access to public transportation:\n\nHotel Forum: This hotel is located in the historic center of Rome, near the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. It has a metro station right outside the door, making it easy to get around the city. The hotel has a variety of room sizes, including double, twin, and family rooms.\n\nHotel Raphael: This hotel is located in the Monti neighborhood, a short walk from the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. It has a bus stop right in front of the hotel, making it easy to get around the city. The hotel has a variety of room sizes, including double, twin, and family rooms.\n\nHotel Santa Maria: This hotel is located in the Trastevere neighborhood, a lively and charming neighborhood with a lot of restaurants and bars. It has a metro station within walking distance, making it easy to get around the city. The hotel has a variety of room sizes, including double, twin, and family rooms.\n\nI hope this helps!"

Thanks",

I lived in California for many years and helped lots of people planning their dream tour of Tuscany. Now I moved back to Italy. How many days? My main recommendation is not trying to visit as many places as possible... you can only see/enjoy a handful of places in one or two weeks.. then of course each person has is own interests and travel style so, depending on your budget and number of travelers, I would suggest to contact someone that does custom tours for small groups."

If you're a museum and art person, then Florence. If you like architecture and ancient history, Rome. If you're going for the sea and scenery Amalfi or Cinque Terre. If you love rolling hills and beautiful landscapes, Tuscany. Honestly, can't see how you can go wrong in Italy. I've not seen any pictures on this group from anywhere in all of Italy that haven't been breathtaking. Enjoy! Good luck!"

We chose Bologna because it\u2019s so centrally located and easy to get to other cities, but we have such a limited amount of time, so the real question is, WHERE should we go? We are not as much into churches and historical sights as we are foodies and would love to shop and explore quaint neighborhoods. So if you only had a handful of days to travel from Bologna, where would you absolutely want to go?"

Here are a few \"must go\" cities in Italy that are a short train ride from Bologna:\n\n* **Florence:** The capital of the Tuscany region, Florence is home to the world-famous Uffizi Gallery and the Accademia Gallery, where you can see Michelangelo's David. Florence is also a great city for wandering around and exploring the narrow streets and alleyways.\n[Image of Florence, Italy]\n[Image of Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy]\n* **Siena:** This beautiful medieval city is known for its Piazza del Campo, a large square with a shell-shaped fountain. Siena is also home to the Leaning Tower of San Gimignano, a 14th-century tower that is one of the most iconic landmarks in Italy.\n* **Pisa:** This city is home to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. Pisa is also a great place to visit if you are interested in history and architecture.\n* **Modena:** This city is known for its balsamic vinegar and its Ferrari museum. Modena is also a great place to visit if you are interested in food and wine.\n\nIf you are interested in art and history, I would recommend visiting Florence and Siena. If you are interested in food and wine, I would recommend visiting Modena. And if you are interested in seeing a unique landmark, I would recommend visiting Pisa.\n\nNo matter which cities you choose to visit, you are sure to have a great time in Italy!"

Omg it\u2019s so much cheaper compared to other cities. So laid back. Best food. You will love it!!! I\u2019m excited for you.\n\nYou could go to Florence in less time than it takes for most people to commute to work.\nA fast 40 minutes.\n\nThe Florence station connects to the bus terminal. From there you can go anywhere in Tuscany.\n\nVenice 1.5 hours. Stay overnight and see San Marco square at night."
